<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">THE MAN WHO COULD SMELL MONEY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow is watching us again!&rdquo; whispered
Tom Carroll to his companions, Nicky
and Cliff, as he adjusted a pack strap on the
Mexican burro behind which he sheltered his
face as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he keeps on, I&rsquo;m going over and ask him
what&rsquo;s next!&rdquo; Nicky said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out what he
means by it or know the reason why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky was impulsive and quick: he preferred
action to reasoning, and was usually more willing
to meet trouble than to avoid it. Tom, who
was generally as cool and as level headed as
Cliff, the oldest of the trio, seemed inclined to
agree with the youngest chum; but Cliff, cinching
up his pony&rsquo;s saddle, shook his head at
Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;We came out here to try to learn something
about Tom&rsquo;s sister, not to court trouble,&rdquo; he
urged. &ldquo;I guess that chap is simply curious
about us and is watching to see that we saddle
up properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it any of his business?&rdquo; demanded Nicky.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just one of the miners having his lunch.
What business is it of his what we do or how
we do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks pretty mean,&rdquo; Cliff admitted.</p>
<p>Tom, having taken a moment to consider, as
he generally did, came to a conclusion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not so sure that he is mean,&rdquo; he told his two
friends. &ldquo;That scar across his face, and his
bleary eyes, make him look pretty fierce; but
he may be perfectly innocent of any wrong
thoughts. As long as he only watches, he isn&rsquo;t
breaking any law or hurting us. Are you fellows
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set!&rdquo; answered Cliff, patting his pony&rsquo;s
flank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, let&rsquo;s not bother about a rough looking
miner who has hardly taken his eyes off us
since we came here this morning. Nicky, run
over to the mine office building and tell Mr.
Gray we&rsquo;ve got everything ready to start back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Nicky dropped his own pony&rsquo;s rein over its
head, while Tom, with his lithe movements apparent
in the ease with which he mounted his
own animal, caught the bridle of an extra mount
and Cliff took the burro&rsquo;s leading rope. Nicky
ambled across the flat ground toward a zinc
sheathed shack at a little distance.</p>
<p>Cliff and Tom sat on their ponies, watching
covertly as the man they had been discussing
finished the remnants of his chili con carne,
wiped his mouth on a ragged coat sleeve, rose
and strolled with a seemingly aimless air
toward the upper level on which stood the engine
house, the mouth of the mine and other
timbered and metal covered buildings.</p>
<p>Nicky, on his return, looked around, saw that
the man was gone and voiced a proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gray says he won&rsquo;t be ready to go for
more than an hour,&rdquo; he informed his chums.
&ldquo;The mine superintendent is telling him about
some old Aztec curios he owns, and you know
how that will chain Cliff&rsquo;s father in his chair.
What do you say if we take a little gallop down
the trail&mdash;a race, maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom vetoed the race: they had a good ride
before them and he did not want to start on
winded ponies: however, he agreed to a short
ride on a trail that they had not explored and
the trio rode off, tying their burro to await
their return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The extra pony, also left standing, may have
wondered why his own rider, the older one, had
not come; but he waited with the patience of a
well trained animal.</p>
<p>As the boys rode along, the trail became rapidly
steeper and the small plateau narrowed
into a rough, rocky coulee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is too bad,&rdquo; Nicky said, with a
sidewise glance of rueful sympathy toward
Tom. &ldquo;After we came all the way to Mexico
City and then rode out here to the old mine, it
is too bad that we can&rsquo;t get even a trace of your
missing sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think the authorities
would know something, after all these
years, or that we could pick up some clues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been different in the United
States,&rdquo; said Nicky, with a sense of pride in his
native land. &ldquo;Our detectives don&rsquo;t let the grass
grow under their feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; broke in Cliff, &ldquo;many girls, and
men and women, too, disappear in America and
never are found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were no eye-witnesses, except the
ones they found dead, after the bandits made
their raid&mdash;that&rsquo;s why there were no clues,&rdquo;
Tom added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he finished, sadly, &ldquo;I guess my own
private mystery will never be solved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Nicky said, with his usual
optimism. &ldquo;You know, it seemed as though
Cliff&rsquo;s father would never be heard from again,
after he went to Peru&mdash;but we got a letter, or
Cliff did, and we went down there with Mr.
Whitley, our history instructor&mdash;and not only
rescued Mr. Gray from the hidden Inca city,
but we saw a lot of adventure and got some of
the Inca treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your mystery seemed as though it
would never be solved, Nicky,&rdquo; Cliff reminded
his friend. &ldquo;With only half of a cipher message
left to your family by Captain Kidd, it was possible
for us to find the hidden treasure in the
Florida keys and have a lot of excitement in
the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And both adventures started out very
tamely,&rdquo; Nicky was trying hard to brighten up
his comrade; but Tom only shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is different,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Nicky and Cliff referred to two exciting
escapades in which all three had participated.
Because each of them had had a mystery in his
life the three had drawn very close in the bonds
of friendship, and had formed themselves into
a secret order which they called the Mystery
Boys. They had secret gestures by which they
could communicate with one another in the
presence of others without divulging the fact
that they did so: also, they had initiation rites
and binding oaths and strict codes which held
them together and bound them to help each
other in every way to solve their individual
mysteries.</p>
<p>Cliff&rsquo;s mystery, as Nicky said, had been
cleared up in the summer past: the following
winter the trio, while in Jamaica, had run onto
some information which had begun the adventure
through which the hidden treasure mystery
of Nicky&rsquo;s family had been brought to a
successful end.</p>
<p>While in Cliff&rsquo;s case the reward had not
been financially large, he had found his father.
In Nicky&rsquo;s adventure no life had been involved
in danger, but a buried mass of gold bars had
been recovered and distributed fairly so that
each of the three was, in a modest way, provided
for as far as riches went: they were not
made millionaires, because the treasure had to
be shared with others involved in Captain
Kidd&rsquo;s legacy, but they were &ldquo;well fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in Tom&rsquo;s case, the mystery was of a
different kind, and there was in it not only the
element of tragedy, but, as well, the element of
uncertainty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Hardly more than five years ago Tom, confined
to his bed by a bad attack of measles, had
been thus prevented from going with his father
and his sister, a year older than he, to Mexico.
That saved his life, which is a curious thing to
think about&mdash;that sickness saved him from a
worse fate.</p>
<p>Mr. Carrol, an engineer and mining expert,
sent to inspect some mining property, had left
Tom under the care of an older cousin; but so
eager had eleven-year-old Margery been to see
the strange country that Mr. Carrol had taken
her with him.</p>
<p>That farewell, looking out of a darkened
room at the bright hair and half-smiling, half-tearful
face, had been Tom&rsquo;s last sight of his
beloved sister; and that clasp of hands between
father and son had been the last they could
ever exchange.</p>
<p>For, shortly after the arrival of the engineer
and his daughter at a remote mining property,
bandits had descended from the mountains in
a raid, seemingly because they knew that gold
to a high value had been amassed and stored
until time to load it on burros and with armed
guards take it to the railway shipping point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>In the news, meagre and disjointed, which
Tom had received, it was supposed that the
bandits had come to the mine during the night,
had been seen and attacked by the engineer and
several other Americans who were in charge of
the property. A fight must have ensued, but
one disastrous to the defenders, because the
gold was gone and the mine was deserted when
the workmen came from their hovels far down
the trail the next day. According to what Tom
heard, they had found his father and the other
Americans, all past any earthly aid.</p>
<p>But there had been no news of Margery!</p>
<p>With his heart torn by his bereavement and
with terror gnawing at his mind day and night,
even at the tender age of ten, Tom had begged
his father&rsquo;s cousin to use every effort to learn
what had happened to his sister. All that
could be done, had been done.</p>
<p>But the family had little money and although
the Government made inquiries and State departments
exchanged notes and the Mexican
authorities declared that soldiers had scoured
the neighborhood of the mine and the passes in
the sierras&mdash;and some of the bandits had been
caught and punished!&mdash;there was no trace of
the little girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>No wonder that Tom suffered anguish every
time he thought of her. Was she wandering
about in the mountains, alone, starved? Was
she a captive among the bandits? Those who
had been caught declared by everything they
reverenced that they had not seen her at any
time nor after the retreat had they seen her in
their camp among the cordilleras. Even the
gold was gone! A renegade white man&mdash;they
had not known his nationality&mdash;had incited the
attack, seeming to guess that there was money
to be had. But he had disappeared during the
fighting&mdash;and so, they averred, had the gold
bags and the burros.</p>
<p>Was the little, sunny-haired Margery his
prisoner also? Tom never had learned, for no
trace of him&mdash;or of her&mdash;had ever been found.</p>
<p>Naturally, even after five years, the pain was
deep and the scar still burned; that is why he
had been so anxious to see the summer vacation
arrive at Amadale Military Academy, where he
and his chums were students. Cliff was glad in
one way, also, because the end of the term saw
his graduation. That meant that he could devote
all of his time, for the summer and as long
as might be necessary, to his father, Mr. Gray,
a great scholar and student of old civilizations.
Mr. Gray wrote books on the subject of ancient
history, and went to many strange places to get
his facts. Cliff looked forward to the experiences
and the knowledge he would gain; but
mostly he was glad to be able to help his father
whose health was not of the best since his years
of captivity among the hidden Inca survivors
in the Peruvian cordilleras.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Nicky, in the same class with Tom, and with
a year yet to be passed in study and training
of an athletic and disciplinary sort, looked forward
to the vacation, because he knew that Mr.
Gray was going to Mexico to study the Aztec
civilization of a time long past, and to collect
Indian relics and other material for a Museum
in New York&mdash;and Cliff would go with him to
help him and to write for him when his eyes
were tired, and to superintend digging and so
on; and Tom had been invited to accompany
them, because he could in that way see at first
hand the district of Mexico which had bred
tragedy in its wild mountains for him. That
meant that the inseparables would feel that
their ranks were incomplete without the third
member of the Mystery Boys, and so, of course,
Nicky was with the others.</p>
<p>They had hired ponies and a guide and had
ridden out to the mine, with the results which
the boys had just discussed during their ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet this is the very trail those bandits
used,&rdquo; Nicky was saying as Tom reined in his
pony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he said listlessly, &ldquo;but there won&rsquo;t
be any clues or signs on it after five years.
We&rsquo;d better go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I wish you&rsquo;d look!&rdquo; gasped Nicky,
turning his head and spying something down
the trail. &ldquo;There comes that fellow who was
watching us like a hawk&mdash;and he&rsquo;s&mdash;yes, he
is!&mdash;he&rsquo;s riding Mr. Gray&rsquo;s pony.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait and see what he is after,&rdquo; suggested
Cliff at once. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re three to one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Nicky hotly, &ldquo;and if he &lsquo;starts&rsquo;
anything, I&rsquo;ll start him toward that chasm over
yonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man riding toward them was quite tall,
and rangey of build. He did not show his full
height for he rode, as he walked, stooped over.
He seemed to be in the last stages of physical
slovenliness, and&mdash;even ignoring the scar
across his face from the base of his nose to his
left jawbone&mdash;his features looked sinister.
Actually it was moral laxity, too much drinking
and careless living that had pulled down a
frame which must at one time have been erect
and powerful, and broke a once daring spirit
till it looked out of bleary eyes with dull,
apathetic boredom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you following us?&rdquo; Nicky spoke
up as soon as the man was close enough to hear.</p>
<p>The man rode up closer still, reined in his
pony, dropped the leather onto the animal&rsquo;s
neck and smiled ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, in a husky, whispering sort of
way, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m follerin&rsquo; you. &rsquo;Cause why? That&rsquo;s
what you want to know. &rsquo;Cause why! Ain&rsquo;t it
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly we want to know,&rdquo; chimed in
Cliff. &ldquo;Why are you following us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;He-he-he-he!&rdquo; It was a shrill, cracked sort
of laugh. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause Henry Morgan smells
money&mdash;that&rsquo;s why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Morgan!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Nicky started. He
read a great deal about pirates and piracy because
he had been interested in the cipher which
Captain Kidd had given to one of his ancestors,
&ldquo;Henry Morgan! Any relation to the old
pirate?&rdquo; None of them were afraid; they were
simply curious, and a little bit annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Morgan&mdash;the pirate! He-he-he!
Maybe. Who knows! Can pirates smell
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must,&rdquo; Nicky declared. &ldquo;They were
always crazy about getting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I must be related to &rsquo;em. &rsquo;Cause
why? &rsquo;Cause Hen Morgan can smell money.
And&mdash;&rsquo;cause Hen Morgan is crazy for it.
And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he fixed them with a bleared eye and
rubbed his hands&mdash;and the chums drew their
ponies closer on the trail as he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Hen Morgan smells money&mdash;an&rsquo; he
smells it on you, or around you&mdash;and he wants
some of it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE MYSTERY BOYS GET NEWS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You talk one way and act the opposite!&rdquo;
Tom made his tones sarcastic to cover his inward
trepidation. He was not exactly afraid
for he did not think that the man had any
weapon and they outnumbered him. But Tom
wanted to communicate secretly and he did not
see just how to do it.</p>
<p>The Mystery Boys had two secret sign
manuals: one was for asking and answering
questions, and the other was for suggesting a
course of action. But neither had been planned
for use while seated on ponies, and such signs
as the folding of arms, or the tying of a shoelace,
were out of the question. So Tom kept
on talking while he thought busily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you can smell money,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;and then you follow us out here to rob us.
Why, I don&rsquo;t think we could get enough money
together to buy a bag of chili beans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat to his surprise the man made a
violent gesture of denial.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>He sidled his pony a little closer, put up a
hand as if to drive away any suggestion of robbery,
and spoke again in his husky voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that! Hen Morgan aren&rsquo;t no robber.
&rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause robbers takes
chances. They takes some likely person and
risks getting a lot of money&mdash;and sometimes
they guess wrong. But not Henry Morgan. Oh,
no! &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause he don&rsquo;t guess. He
smells money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chums looked at one another dubiously.
Was this man off his head? He wasn&rsquo;t there
to rob them! He didn&rsquo;t guess&mdash;he smelled
money! What was his purpose? &ldquo;You smelled
wrong, for once!&rdquo; Tom declared, after a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried the husky voice, &ldquo;not Hen
Morgan. He sees you three come a-ridin&rsquo; up
to Dead Hope mine, with the old gent. He sees
how the super&rsquo;tendent calls some of us miners
in and he asks &rsquo;em, later, what it&rsquo;s all about.
&rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause Hen Morgan knows something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knows something? About what?&rdquo; demanded
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light down off your ponies an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you.
&rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause it takes too much work
keepin&rsquo; these critters standing still. Light!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Tom looked at his companions. Cliff nodded
and slid from his saddle. Nicky and Tom followed
his example. There was no danger, that
they could see, and on the ground they had
more freedom of movement than while mounted
on strange, and possibly unruly mustangs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Henry Morgan, seating himself
on a boulder and rolling a cigarette expertly
with his right hand, while three mystified,
rather eager youths stood watching him, &ldquo;now&mdash;Hen
Morgan said he smelled money on you
or around you, and he was right. &rsquo;Cause why?
Look at it! You didn&rsquo;t ride out here to look
for mining property; you come a-hunting for
some news of a certain thing what happened a
good while ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know we did?&rdquo; Nicky asked
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the miners who was called to the office.
But they didn&rsquo;t know anything. Nobody
did. Nobody does&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom almost sprang forward, so eager was he
as the import of Henry&rsquo;s words flashed through
his mind. &ldquo;Do you? Do you know about&mdash;about
my sister&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With maddening deliberateness the man held
up a hand for silence, searched for and found a
crumpled card of matches, struck one and carefully
ignited the end of his cigarette. Then, at
last, he nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hen Morgan is the only man who does know
anything&mdash;but he don&rsquo;t know much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you know anything at all, when you
found out that we were hunting for facts, why
didn&rsquo;t you come out in the open and tell?&rdquo; Tom
said it angrily, for the suspense was torture to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hen Morgan uses his head, that&rsquo;s why!&rdquo; He
blew a cloud of smoke, coughed a little, and resumed
his confidential, husky whispering. &ldquo;You
come here lookin&rsquo; for news. That means money
behind you. &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause no three
young lads comes all this way without money.
Now, reasons I, they&rsquo;ll pay for news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Tom, &ldquo;I see. You know something
and you want to bargain with us and sell
your information for all you can get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d expect,&rdquo; Nicky cut in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; Cliff urged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay
you all your information turns out to be worth.
But we&rsquo;ll go back and talk it over with my
father, out in the open, not up here in the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, easy!&rdquo; begged Henry Morgan. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t go back, right yet. &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause
we&rsquo;ll make our bargain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky impulsively caught his pony&rsquo;s saddle
horn, started to lift a foot for the stirrup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back
and get help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Henry Morgan stood up. &ldquo;The minute you
rides down the trail, I rides off&mdash;up that way.&rdquo;
He waved his arm. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t ever find the
head bandit, that time, did they? Nor the gold?
&rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause there&rsquo;s a way they got
took to safety, and I know that way! If you
don&rsquo;t want my news, and won&rsquo;t strike a bargain,
well and good. But if you do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
paused.</p>
<p>Tom was scratching his left ear quietly with
his finger, and with one accord Nicky and Cliff
folded their arms and the Mystery Boys&rsquo; council
was in session without an outward evidence
that anyone could notice or read.</p>
<p>Tom shifted the visor of his cap a tiny bit
one way, then back: it was a silent appeal,
&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff picked up a pebble and shied it aimlessly
to one side: that was a code sign which meant
that the last word of every sentence in his next
speech would have a meaning. Then he spoke
up, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see. You said what? You&rsquo;ve got
news? Likely, that is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mentally, as he spoke, Tom noted the pauses,
and then, connecting the words that ended each
short sentence, he discerned that Cliff&rsquo;s advice
was: &ldquo;See&mdash;what&mdash;news&mdash;is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Tom moved the little finger of his right hand
gently, knowing that Cliff watched for that sign
of agreement: to use the left finger would mean
denial or rejection of the advice; but Tom took
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to let us know what you have to
sell,&rdquo; he addressed Henry Morgan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing
to pass my word and strike hands on it, if
you have any knowledge that will help us to find
my missing sister, I will pay you anything
within reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three chums half expected Morgan to
demur. If he told them what he knew it would
be worthless to him; once they knew it they
could use it. However, they got a slight surprise,
for Morgan merely grinned and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause
I want help. If I tell you, you can see how good
it is&mdash;what I know. And even when I tell you,
I&rsquo;m still sure of my reward. &rsquo;Cause why?
&rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;ll tell you everything but one man&rsquo;s
name&mdash;and without that, you can&rsquo;t do a thing&mdash;at
the same time Hen Morgan can show that he
knows what you want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told them, quietly. They thrilled, they
shuddered; they drew closer. Each and all, the
Mystery Boys forgot that they were out on a
lonely trail, forgot that the man was bargaining,
in a way, for a human life. His story
chained them in spellbound attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>When he completed it, Tom held out his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a real help&mdash;your story does,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not of age to handle my own
money, but I know that Mr. Gray, who is acting
as the custodian of my money, will agree to give
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated, partly to see how much
Henry Morgan would name, and partly to plan
in his own mind what to do. That they must
have the name of a certain important figure in
the bandit raid, cost how it might, Tom knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not make it a set figure,&rdquo; said Morgan,
again surprising the trio. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause why?
&rsquo;Cause Hen Morgan has got a bigger stake to
gain than what you could give. But you could
help him to get it. And he could help you to
get what you want. And so, everybody would
be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agree?&rdquo; asked Tom&rsquo;s eyes, and the bent
first finger that touched his right thumb. Nicky
and Cliff signaled a &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s reasonable,&rdquo; Tom nodded. &ldquo;What
do you expect us to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I ask is that you pay the expense of the
search&mdash;and take me along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, only, if I help you find that&mdash;certain
fellow&mdash;and we do find him, and he tells me
what I want to know too&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got to sign a
paper that you&rsquo;ll help me to get to locate the
Golden Sun&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Golden Sun?&rdquo; cried Nicky and Cliff together.</p>
<p>Henry nodded. &ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;The
Golden Sun. It&rsquo;s a mountain of gold, the way
I understand about it. And I got as much right
to it as this&mdash;other fellow. You&rsquo;ll see why later
on. But I&rsquo;ve got to have your word&mdash;you, the
one who wants to find his sister!&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll
help me&mdash;and maybe share with me in the mine,
eh? &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause Hen Morgan is generous,
he is&mdash;and if you help him he&rsquo;ll help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pass my word,&rdquo; said Tom, solemnly, and
gripped hands with Morgan, just a little hesitantly
at the contact with the soiled, rough
paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I know you&rsquo;ll not break your
word&mdash;you don&rsquo;t look like that kind. Mount
and let&rsquo;s ride and talk to the old gent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky. &ldquo;Off again for adventure&mdash;and
success, I hope!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">HENRY MORGAN&rsquo;S STORY</span></h2>
<p>They rode back to the mine property quickly.
It did not take long to locate Mr. Gray, Cliff&rsquo;s
elderly father: he listened in silence to the
eager trio as they broke in upon one another,
so excited were they, and so eager to get his
opinion in regard to the feasibility of starting
at once for the Central American coast.</p>
<p>Henry Morgan had exacted from them all a
promise that they would not disclose what he
had told them to the mine superintendent, a
rather lazy and careless man who seemed to
realize that since the mine was hardly paying
for its expense, his work was only a means of
making a living until the mine finally &ldquo;petered
out&rdquo; and he went elsewhere. The chums had
already discovered that there were many adventurous
and roving white men, from Mexico
down all the Central American coast and into
South America, as well as among the Virgin
Islands, who eked out a living wherever and
however chance offered. Henry Morgan was of
that type, but much drinking and loose living
had made him a very poor specimen, indeed, of
the adventure-loving, roving American.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Morgan knew so much, why did he
not come to us at once?&rdquo; was Mr. Gray&rsquo;s natural
first question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he explains it logically,&rdquo; answered
Tom, &ldquo;and Nicky and Cliff agree with me.&rdquo;
They nodded. &ldquo;He is afraid that he might get
&lsquo;mixed up&rsquo; with the Mexican authorities, and
that would spoil everything,&rdquo; Nicky explained.
&ldquo;Let him tell you what he told us, won&rsquo;t you,
Mr. Gray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elderly scholar and writer nodded.
Henry Morgan cleared his throat and, in his
husky, rusty voice, related the tale again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a rover all my life,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;from kid days on. &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause I
liked to see new places and have excitement.
Sometimes I got more nor I bargained for.
Sometimes I near starved. But I always come
through all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sketched briefly the years he had spent
roving up and down the Caribbean coast of the
Central American states, and the adjacent
islands, and over to Cuba during an insurrection,
and in Haiti, while a revolution was in
progress, and gold-prospecting in Spanish
Honduras.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was while I was in Spanish Honduras, in
the Mosquito Indian&rsquo;s country,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I
met the fellow I told these lads about. He was
lookin&rsquo; for gold, and there was supposed to be
a gold mountain inland, but the Indians in the
interior was too dangerous for us to risk gettin&rsquo;
in. Well, finally, we decided to give up hunting
for any mine there&mdash;at least, I did. I was down
on the coast, near the sand point at Brower&rsquo;s
Lagoon when a sailing sloop came in over the
reef one day, and when I found out they needed
a hand, I shipped on her and left&mdash;this other
fellow&mdash;inland, still bound he would some time
locate that mine or mountain of gold and claim
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He explained to the interested quartet that
he went into so much detail because it all had
something to do with the later part of his yarn.
They nodded and did not interrupt him once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&mdash;other fellow&mdash;had made great friends
with an old Indian, up river&mdash;oh, quite a ways
up the Rio Patuca. This old Indian must have
lived for centuries. &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause he
knew legends and history that his own tribe had
forgot: and he knew medicines and herbs, the
same as the oldest of the other medicine men
couldn&rsquo;t even remember. And Be&mdash;this other
fellow&mdash;had got real close in his confidence and
said this old Toosa&mdash;that was his name&mdash;would
show him a way to find the golden mountain, so
I left him there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>He skipped quickly over the following years
until the time, about six years before, when he
had found himself in Mexico and, hearing of
some rich mines in the sierras, had eventually
reached and found employment at the mine
which, in its prosperity, was called the Great
Hope, but which, since, had degenerated in
value until it was jokingly styled the Dead
Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whenever I get in civilized places where
there is drink,&rdquo; Henry continued, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do
nothin&rsquo; for myself. &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause it
gets me and holds me and drags me down.&rdquo; He
made a gesture of rueful resignation. Then,
rolling a fresh cigarette, he began to bring his
story into the matters which most intensely
gripped the imaginations of the chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was made assistant to the super&rsquo;,&rdquo; he told
them, &ldquo;but it wasn&rsquo;t long before I got so bad
and so low that they kicked me out. Well, I
was sore about it and made up my mind to get
even. But I didn&rsquo;t. &rsquo;Cause why? Well, I
struck up with B&mdash;with this other fellow,
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Whoever this man with the name he so mysteriously
withheld might be, he was evidently
of the same general type as Henry. The latter
met him, he said, in a &ldquo;dive&rdquo; in Mexico City,
and in a ribald fit of liquor stupor the friend
had gabbled and raved and ranted about finding
&ldquo;the Golden Sun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was what we had decided we&rsquo;d name
our mountain, when we found it,&rdquo; Henry explained.
&ldquo;So I was all excited. But he was too
far gone to tell me anything I could pin onto.
Then I got mad at him and started a fight
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he pointed to his scarred face, &ldquo;this
is my souvenir! It laid me up in a dinky hospital
for weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, without money, weak and rather sobered
in mind as well as physically, he came out
of the hospital, Henry Morgan decided to drift
back to the mine, see if he could be reinstated,
and live a better life, he told the chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like to interrupt,&rdquo; began Mr. Gray,
&ldquo;but I fail to see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait, Dad,&rdquo; begged his son, Cliff, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
coming to it, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gray leaned back and studied the bleared
eyes while Henry Morgan resumed his story
and the chums almost held their breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to tell all that. &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause
it counts in the finish&mdash;or will, if you see it the
way I do,&rdquo; declared the rover. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t waste
time sayin&rsquo; how I got back, what I went
through. But get back to Dead Hope I did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;And it was on the night of the bandits&rsquo;
raid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Gray saw why the boys were so
absorbed. They knew what was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dark night I come a-stumblin&rsquo; up the
path, yonder, weak and hungry and staggerin&rsquo;&mdash;I
hadn&rsquo;t eat no food for a day. All of a
sudden there was a yelling and a shouting and
guns a-popping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; gasped Nicky, thrilled
anew by the recital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stopped,&rdquo; said Henry, matter-of-factly, &ldquo;I
stopped. There was flashes of guns and people
running around and the men on horses shooting
and riding after people in their night-clothes&mdash;the
ones that was on the ground, I mean, not
the bandits. They was dressed, of course! One
o&rsquo; the men a-horseback rode right close to
where I had dropped back behind the rock, and
he saw me. &lsquo;Here, grab this rein,&rsquo; he snapped
at me&mdash;and you can believe it or not&mdash;it was
B&mdash;it was my old pal I had last seen in Mexico
City, drunk, and he had give me this slash with
a broken bottle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;B&mdash;who&rsquo;s Be&mdash;?&rdquo; asked Tom quickly, trying
a clever way to surprise the man into revealing
the name they sought, without having to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be&mdash;oh, he&rsquo;s the man I&rsquo;ve been talkin&rsquo; of,&rdquo;
said Henry, favoring Tom with a steady stare
and then, suddenly, breaking into his high
chuckle. Then he sobered down and went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little boys what asks questions finds out
just what they wants to know&mdash;he-he-he!&rdquo; he
reproved Tom who apologized for interrupting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Henry said. &ldquo;Well, I yelled
after him, but he was runnin&rsquo; towards the excitement,
hollering and shouting, and I was too
busy with that horse of his to run after him. I
was scared to let the critter loose for fear o&rsquo;
what he&rsquo;d do to me. I guessed he&rsquo;d fell in with
a rough gang and had decided to lead them or
be with them on this raid. I judged there must
be a lot of gold laid up in the mine house, waiting
for burros and guards to carry it to the
railroad. If I let the horse go, this fellow would
maybe give me a dose of lead. So I hung on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse was excited and scared, wasn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was, and no mistake! He began to drag
me and I hung on, yellin&rsquo; at him to quit, and
him draggin&rsquo; and rearing up. First thing I
knew, I was bein&rsquo; dragged over to that pass we
rode in this afternoon. The bandits must o&rsquo;
come out of it earlier and the horse wanted to
get home, maybe. Anyhow, towards that he
was draggin&rsquo; me. And then&mdash;I saw a couple of
Mex. desperadoes, so they looked with their tall
straw hats and dirty, raggedy clo&rsquo;es, and they
was drivin&rsquo; about six burros with heavy sacks
tied over their backs, all they could carry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; gasped Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold it most likely was. Anyhow, here come
that friend of mine&mdash;he was my friend once, I
mean, before&mdash;&rdquo; he touched his scar. &ldquo;He
had a rifle and was runnin&rsquo;. There was still
shootin&rsquo; going on, and a horse was down one
place and a bandit another, and men stretched
out yonder and hither. This fellow he run to
me and pushed me to one side and pushed a
rifle in my hand, and he said, &lsquo;Hold this pass
for ten minutes with this rifle, and then retreat
up it about fifty feet, and I&rsquo;ll be in ambush and
I&rsquo;ll surprise the guys, and what you can&rsquo;t stop&mdash;I
will! Then we&rsquo;ll divvy the gold!&rsquo; So I
grabbed the rifle and took a place. At the same
minute I hear a screech and yonder, out of the
sleepin&rsquo; quarters, comes a little girl, a-runnin&rsquo;
as tight as she could run, with a big ruffian
a-chasin&rsquo; her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Tom, aghast and almost shaking
in his excitement, &ldquo;Oh&mdash;my sis&mdash;little Margery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little girl with bright hair!&rdquo; agreed Henry.
&ldquo;Well, before I scarcely knowed what was
what that&mdash;er, friend&mdash;had shot down the
&lsquo;greasers&rsquo; with the burros, stopped the fellow
chasin&rsquo; the little girl, scooped her in his arms
and set her onto the saddle of his horse and
was up behind her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the bandits see it?&rdquo; asked Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had been so busy finishin&rsquo; off the engineer
and the other white men&mdash;and they made
a good stand, let me say it!&mdash;they was occupied
too much to notice the actions goin&rsquo; on up by
the pass. But they saw what was what about
then, and come a-yellin&rsquo;. I took cover, and
begun to use that rifle. There was a full clip
in it and I had another one shoved into my
hands, and while that wild pal of mine rode up
the pass, drivin&rsquo; the burros, I stood off about
four of the bandits that wasn&rsquo;t wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Morgan wiped his dry lips and
cleared his roughened throat. Tom hurried him
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you backed down the trail&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; Mr. Gray exclaimed, adding to
the chorus of the younger voices, for they had
not heard the details before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; Henry repeated. &ldquo;Not a sign of
help. That fellow was gone, slicker&rsquo;n grease,
with the little girl and the burros and the gold.
I was caught, of course. The bandits tried to
get out of me what I knew and I told them exact
facts like you&rsquo;ve just heard. I was mad at
being made to help him &lsquo;double-cross&rsquo; his gang
and they saw I was telling the truth. Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
he broke off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he got a letter, a couple of months ago,
he says,&rdquo; Tom took up the recital. &ldquo;Another
adventurer Mr. Morgan knows, wrote him,
and&mdash;what did you say he wrote?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wrote me that he had run onto&mdash;this
fellow we been talking about, down in Colon&mdash;Panama,
you know! Said he was livin&rsquo; like a
millionaire, and was talkin&rsquo; that he was gettin&rsquo;
gold off of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &lsquo;from&rsquo; he meant, of course&mdash;&ldquo;off
of some Indians. I guess it&rsquo;s out of the
Golden Sun. So, now, gent, my proposal is
this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how to get where that Toosa, the old
Indian, is. He will know about&mdash;this fellow&mdash;if
he&rsquo;s located that Golden Sun. But I couldn&rsquo;t
pay the fare from here to the coast, let alone
get to Spanish Honduras. That&rsquo;s where you
come in. You finance me, while I try to find&mdash;that
man. Then we&rsquo;ll all learn what we
want&mdash;you, where he took the little girl, what
happened to her. Me, where that mine is. I
staked him plenty of times, I have right to a
share in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would we get there?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have to hire a boat to coast along to the
outer reefs and the mouth o&rsquo; the Rio Patuca,
then we&rsquo;d have to get them Mosquito Indians
to take us up the river in canoes. It&rsquo;s rough
country. What say if I go alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three young fellows shook their heads
violently, thus indicating how much they
trusted him.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray, also, shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have to take time to think this over
very seriously,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am too old and
weak to brave the dangers of such a trip. I
can&rsquo;t let you lads go alone, or with Mr.
Morgan&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just call me &lsquo;Hen&rsquo;&mdash;the &lsquo;Hen that lays the
golden eggs!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or with &lsquo;Hen,&rsquo;&rdquo; smiled Mr. Gray, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
And there he stopped.</p>
<p>Their mounts were unsaddled and they
stayed on overnight because of the new development.
But after an evening of eager discussion,
with urgent pleas for action by the youths and
hesitancy on the part of Mr. Gray, their course
of action was still undecided. Leaving Morgan
with a promise to &ldquo;get in touch&rdquo; the minute
they made a plan, they rode slowly away down
the trail the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Mr. Gray would let us go &lsquo;on our
own,&rsquo;&rdquo; Nicky said wistfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;He feels that there are a lot of holes in
Henry&rsquo;s story,&rdquo; said Cliff. &ldquo;We looked at the
trail, and how any half dozen burros and their
load of gold could get away in ten minutes is
more than he can understand. And, if he was
&lsquo;fired&rsquo; from the mine, why is he there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those things are easy to explain, I think,&rdquo;
Tom stated. &ldquo;About the burros&mdash;I asked him
and he said he guessed his former friend must
have unloaded them and dropped the gold sacks
over the cliffs or into some hole and covered it
up and turned the burros loose, or drove them
into the chasm up the trail. He came to work
at the mine again when the new superintendent
was employed there, and that was natural because
the new man did not know him or his
record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it sound better, but there are
still funny points,&rdquo; Cliff replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, suddenly squaring his
shoulders, &ldquo;Cliff, you know how anxious you
were to leave no stone unturned when you were
trying to learn about your father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to leave any stone unturned in
this case, either,&rdquo; agreed his chum, and Nicky
nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;And there is one stone
I know about that I am going to turn as soon
as we reach Mexico City again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What it was he kept to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">TOM BREAKS THE TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>The next ten days were dull ones for the
Mystery Boys. Mexico was in a state of excitement,
due to the approach of the Presidential
election; and, while the revolutionary times
were gone and a more orderly election would
take place, there were some excitable spirits in
the city whose outbreaks made it unwise for
the youths to go out on the streets too often.</p>
<p>Cliff was busy enough for he worked with
his father: Mr. Gray was working on a theory
that all of the Indian tribes from North
America, through Mexico, Central America,
Venezuela and down to Peru, were offshoots of
the same original migration from some other
continent, many centuries before the white
people discovered the new continents. He was
writing a book about that migration, and his
work in Mexico dealt with studies of the old
Toltecs, who preceded the establishing of the
Aztec empire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>It surprised the youths to learn how closely
the Toltecs, and the Aztecs later, were allied
with the Incas of Peru in certain ways: both
were agriculturists of a high order, as were the
Texcucans, kindred with the Azteca. But there
was a great contrast in the nature of the
people; while the Incas had been a mild people,
ruling kindly, punishing justly, fighting only
for a necessary cause, the Aztecs had been a
fierce, cruel, actually brutal people, even giving
the name of their war god, Mexitli, to their
land in the corrupted form, Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray was anxious to fill in many gaps in
his history by studying the life and customs
and legends of the host of Central American
tribes, the Mayas, the Chocos, the Mosquito and
Talamanca tribes, as well as the Goajiras, the
San Blas, and others.</p>
<p>But he hesitated, although the adventure offered
in Henry Morgan&rsquo;s proposal would give
him close contact with some of the natives of
at least one section&mdash;Spanish Honduras. The
tribes were all rough, rather fierce, very primitive;
and he was aged, as well as having been
weakened, during his stay among the Incas.
Nevertheless, had he seen a way, he would have
gone into the adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Nicky, staying rather idly in their hotel with
Tom, was glum. He craved excitement; not
only was he active and impulsive, but he was
adventure-loving, athletic and quick, and he
liked to go into strange places and meet new
situations. Also Nicky sympathized keenly
with Tom over the loss of the latter&rsquo;s sister,
and the uncertainty of her fate.</p>
<p>Tom, for his part, most eager of all to go to
the Mosquito country and learn what could be
learned about Margery, did not seem nearly as
despondent as Nicky, nor was he as busy as
Cliff; yet he seemed able to wear a confident air
which puzzled both of his comrades.</p>
<p>Nicky sat with Tom in their hotel room, chafing
at his long inactivity. Tom was busy going
over some books which Cliff&rsquo;s father had found
for him in the public library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a funny one,&rdquo; he exclaimed, indicating
a passage in the book he held. &ldquo;One explorer
was down in the Central Americas, and
because it is so rainy at times he had a mackintosh.
Do you know, Nicky, that mackintosh
gave him more trouble than anything else, because
when the Indians saw him wearing it, as
he came toward their villages on the river in
his canoe, they thought he was a priest, and because
some priests had sometimes been harsh
in trying to compel the Indians to adopt their
creeds, the Indians all ran and hid and this explorer
couldn&rsquo;t get any pictures of them or any
stories.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Nicky smiled forlornly. Cliff, coming in,
with his father, saw Tom with a grin on his
face and his companion looking glum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew what makes Tom so joyful,&rdquo;
Cliff said. &ldquo;Tom, why don&rsquo;t you be a good fellow
and tell your chums what you know that
makes you feel so good. Is it that telegram
you got last Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom grinned with a touch of malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, look here!&rdquo; burst out Nicky, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
not acting fairly to the Mystery Boys&rsquo; order.
You are keeping a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tom answered, grinning still more,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m simply living up to our oath&mdash;with a vengeance.
&lsquo;Telling all, I tell nothing; Seeing All,
I see nothing, Knowing All, I know nothing!&rsquo;&rdquo;
he quoted their oath of allegiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, do you know what it is that he
knows?&rdquo; Cliff appealed to Mr. Gray who smilingly
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to shake it out of him,&rdquo;
cried Cliff. &ldquo;Come on, Nicky.&rdquo; The two attacked
Tom with gusto, letting off some of their
pent-up &ldquo;steam&rdquo; in an old-fashioned tussle that
boded ill for the hotel furniture. Mr. Gray,
only watchful lest they harm any of his old records,
let them have their fun. Panting and
laughing, at last they gave up, still none the
wiser. A knock on the door panels halted their
fun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray, turning from a brief
conversation at the door, &ldquo;There is a gentleman
in the office asking for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman?&rdquo; cried Nicky. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have him come on up, please, sir,&rdquo; begged
Tom, and then turned his back deliberately on
his companions while he stared out of the window;
but Cliff, watching, saw his shoulders
shaking.</p>
<p>Tom expected this arrival! Who could it be?
The door opened. With a simultaneous shout
three youths launched themselves toward the
tall, thin, lank figure that appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill&mdash;&lsquo;quipu&rsquo; Bill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They grabbed him: they pawed him; they
pounded him.</p>
<p>Bill Saunders had been prospecting in the
Peruvian Andes at the time that Cliff had gone
to try to discover if his father was still alive
among a hidden Inca tribe in the cordilleras.
Bill had taken active part in their adventures.
After the successful end of the trip he had, with
his share of money paid him by Mr. Gray,
bought a Texas ranch. The youths heard from
him often. Now, here he was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here&mdash;how did you
know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Nicky began. Then he turned suddenly
on Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you ran off by yourself to
telegraph when we got back to the city, and
that&rsquo;s why you wouldn&rsquo;t tell us what was in
the telegram you got!&rdquo; he accused. &ldquo;You sent
for Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you at the mine, I would leave no
stone unturned to get news of Margery,&rdquo; Tom
admitted. &ldquo;I said I knew one stone I&rsquo;d turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I guess I was it,&rdquo; grinned Bill Saunders,
depositing his long length in a chair.
&ldquo;Your telegram hit me just in time. I don&rsquo;t
know your mind and you don&rsquo;t know mine, but
if there&rsquo;s any chance for a rolling stone to
gather a little more moss, here&rsquo;s the stone, all
ready to roll. Cow-raisin&rsquo; is not very profitable,
just now, and my bank book could stand
a little more fattening. I never did&mdash;and I
never will&mdash;forgive you fellows for leaving me
out when you found the Captain Kidd treasure&mdash;and
me a full-fledged member, paying dues
and all, in the Mystery Boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got ourselves into that adventure so fast
that we didn&rsquo;t have time to send word or even
to think about you,&rdquo; Tom admitted, with some
regret, for Bill was a good companion on adventure
trails, and he was, as he said, a regular
member of their order since they had initiated
him during their Inca experience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, give me the adventure, this time, anyhow,&rdquo;
urged Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe some gold, too,&rdquo; supplemented
Cliff.</p>
<p>Then Tom related the story of their mine
adventure and Henry Morgan&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p>To say that Bill was intrigued and eager
would put it mildly. The ranch life had begun
to grow tame to him: he loved adventure for its
own sake, and for its thrills, as did Nicky. He
began planning a trip without a delay.</p>
<p>Of course Mr. Gray&rsquo;s last objection was removed.
He had good reason to know and to
trust Bill Sanders, and he did both to the full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasted no time,&rdquo; Bill said. &ldquo;I hopped my
cayuse and galloped for the railroad, leaving
my top hand in charge: but while I was laying
over in a Texas town I got a long-distance telephone
call in to a chum of mine in Galveston,
asking if he had that cruising boat of his that
he used to take me on hunting trips in. He did.
We can charter it. It&rsquo;s got an engine. Lots of
cabin and storage room. It can go up pretty
shallow rivers. It&rsquo;s just what we need to go on
an exploring trip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wasted no time,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray. &ldquo;You
took it for granted that you and the boys would
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Bill!&rdquo; praised Tom. &ldquo;My telegram
told him enough to get him started. I thought
I&rsquo;d better break a trail&mdash;we seemed to be stuck
down here in this old hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His comrades praised his idea of summoning
their former comrade. The very next day Bill
and Tom returned to the mine, found Henry
Morgan and had a talk. Bill asked some pretty
sharp questions, but &ldquo;Hen&rdquo; gave satisfying replies
and Bill arranged with him to return to
Mexico City with them at once. This he did.</p>
<p>It seemed no time at all until the trim,
staunch cruiser <i>Porto Bello</i> was in harbor, with
the chums, Bill and Henry aboard, well supplied.
with gasoline, both in her tanks and in five gallon
reserve cans, and with plenty of tinned
food, as well as some arms and ammunition
aboard. They waited only for Mr. Gray who
had determined to become a passenger. He
could explore the coast, he said, and if any real
information could be gleaned he was determined
to secure it. He had as much enthusiasm
for his historical records as the chums had for
Tom&rsquo;s quest, or Henry Morgan and Bill for
news of the mine&mdash;the one Henry&rsquo;s unnamed
friend called &ldquo;The Golden Sun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anchor a-weigh!&rdquo; cried Nicky, when Mr.
Gray came aboard with clearance papers from
the port authorities. &ldquo;Man the capstan, me
bully boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man it yourself,&rdquo; laughed Cliff, working
with his chum at the small winch forward which
drew the cable: they had been off on a trial spin
to see that the engine worked perfectly, and had
dropped anchor a little away from the wharves.
&ldquo;To be nearer being somewhere else,&rdquo; as Nicky
put it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full speed ahead, Andy,&rdquo; called Bill, already
elected Captain by unanimous consent.
The engineer, who accompanied the cruiser to
help and to represent his employer, the boat&rsquo;s
owner, eased his throttle forward, and engaged
the clutch sending the propeller around in the
proper direction. The bow parted the waters
of the bay, and with caps waving, and hurrah
after hurrah, Tom, Nicky and Cliff stood on the
after deck and watched Mexico&rsquo;s humid, sweltering
coastline drop away aft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay your course for the Golden Sun!&rdquo;
begged Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the mystery man of Hen-ry Mo-r-r-r-gan!&rdquo;
chanted Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And news of Margery!&rdquo; added Tom, soberly,
but hopefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">STORM AND STRESS</span></h2>
<p>Out into the sparkling waters of the Gulf of
Mexico the sturdy cruiser, <i>Porto Bello</i>,
ploughed her way. Laying her course in a
quartering slant, partly South and partly East,
Bill Sanders, who was agreed by all to be in
command, shaped up a plan to round the nose
of Yucatan, passing between it and the more
Eastward island of Cuba.</p>
<p>There they turned South, and giving the
reefy, island studded coast of Yucatan a wide
berth because of the jagged rocky formation
and the heavy surf close to shore, they forged
steadily ahead. Their boat was not fast, but
she was steady in heavy seas and had a good
reserve of power in her heavy motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Henry Morgan knew the coast line very well,
and Bill often consulted his judgment. They
did not try to make landings or lie-to during
the nights, preferring to hold on their course,
well out in deep water, for every one on board
was anxious to get to the coast of Honduras as
quickly as possible. Tom and Nicky supplemented
the work of Bill and of Henry as deckhands
and sailors, watching and keeping everything
clean and ship-shape. Cliff, who had a
good deal of mechanical ability, soon made himself
indispensable to Joe Anderson, the engineer,
who was a quiet, rather moody Scotchman.
The boys, without any intention of disrespect,
promptly named him &ldquo;Andy.&rdquo; He accepted
the new name without comment and,
commandeering Cliff&rsquo;s services in the engine
room, soon had as clever an assistant as he
could desire, although he gave few signs of his
inward appreciation. Mr. Gray spent most of
his time arranging the numerous glass beads
and other tawdry, cheap ornaments and fancy
trifles which would be very dear to the untutored
Indians and would serve as trade items
and presents to the chiefs of various tribes.
The youths made a gay jaunt of their trip.</p>
<p>There was only one thing that clouded their
delight: that was the misconduct of Henry
Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way Henry does, very
much,&rdquo; Tom confided to his two chums, as they
rubbed up the brass work in the small wheelhouse,
while Tom held the wheel, giving and
taking a spoke or two as the little vessel felt
the heavy surge of the Caribbean swells, rolling
in great, lifting pulsations from the East, and
heeled under the strong thrust of the trade
wind. &ldquo;Almost as soon as we left port I caught
him with a bottle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; broke in Nicky. &ldquo;He told me it was
a &lsquo;Mexican Tonic&rsquo; to keep him from being
seasick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we know better,&rdquo; Cliff spoke the thought
in all three minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to him, now,&rdquo; Tom said, disgustedly.</p>
<p>From the after deck came a strident, but
husky roar:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For, I&rsquo;m a buccaneer, oh,</p>
<p class="t0">A rowdy-dowdy Buccaneer.</p>
<p class="t0">I cuts &rsquo;em down and I shoots &rsquo;em down</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Cause why?&mdash;I&rsquo;m a buc&mdash;ca&mdash;nee-e-e-e-e-r!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Buccaneer, my hat!&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; to
their clean-living, high-principled friend as he
sauntered to the doorway of the steering room,
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you throw Hen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mexican Tonic&rsquo;
overboard?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find it,&rdquo; Bill said, &ldquo;or I would, in a
minute. We&rsquo;re getting into Caribbean waters
and it won&rsquo;t be long before we are in among
the tricky rocks. We have to steer down
through the Gulf of Honduras and pick up the
reefs outside the Rio Patuca, and that is no
place to be &lsquo;half-seas-over,&rsquo; let me tell you.
Henry knows the course and he can navigate
pretty well when he&rsquo;s &lsquo;straight&rsquo; but I don&rsquo;t like
him in his present condition&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;A rowdy-dowdy Buccane-e-e-e-er!&rdquo; sang
Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a rowdy in his actions, and, goodness
knows! he&rsquo;s dowdy enough in his clothes and
habits,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Nicky, why did you ever let
him look at that book about pirates? He thinks
he&rsquo;s one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he would be interested, having a
name the same as one of the most notorious
pirates,&rdquo; Nicky replied. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the book
that&rsquo;s to blame, it&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Tonic.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down in the cabin and have another
good look,&rdquo; Tom said, letting Bill take
over the wheel, and indicating the course as
Henry had last given it to him. &ldquo;Cliff&rsquo;s father
is very nervous about Henry but he says not
to argue with him, but to make the best of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>He did not find anything: Henry, whatever
his failings, was of a cunning nature when it
came to his own desires and he seemed to know
of places on the boat that the chums could never
think of. As Tom searched, he felt the boat
rising and falling more violently, and lurching
in a half-roll, half-plunge that was not very
pleasant. The cabin was stuffy and close, and
he opened the portholes, wrinkling his nose at
the unpleasant odor in the small space; but a
dash of salt spray flung itself in his face and
hastily he closed the small brass-bound port
glasses and fastened them securely, then went
on deck, clinging to the companion rail to avoid
being thrown down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s blowing up for a storm,&rdquo; said Henry,
clinging to the port rail as Tom came into view,
and lurching wildly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re due for a storm,
my hearty! Oh&mdash;I&rsquo;m a buc&mdash;buc&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stop being a &lsquo;buc&rsquo; and get up
to the wheel house,&rdquo; Tom said snappishly.
&ldquo;Maybe the course ought to be changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I care?&rdquo; Henry cried with a
hoarse, choking guffaw. &ldquo;Many&rsquo;s the pirate
has piled up on the rocks. &rsquo;Cause&mdash;&mdash; &rsquo;Cause
Why? I&rsquo;m a rowdy-dowdy buc&mdash;ca&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a comber, its green crest froth-flecked,
reared its great top on their starboard
quarter. &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; yelled Tom. &ldquo;Grab
something!&rdquo; for Henry was starting in a lurching
gait toward the enclosed cabin companionway.</p>
<p>Tom, himself, caught a stanchion and clung,
holding his breath. The <i>Porto Bello</i> lurched
and staggered under the impact of a huge wave,
and there came a gurgling yell, cut short, the
surge of powerfully dragging water rushing at
Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Before it struck, almost burying him, tugging
at his arms, he saw Henry meet the wave, spinning
around in a mad, fruitless effort to clutch
at the cabin coaming.</p>
<p>Down went Henry, and along the deck he was
washed by the wave. Tom, at the risk of being
himself torn loose and washed away, released
one hand. He made a swift, reaching grab. His
fingers caught Henry&rsquo;s coat, in the surging inferno
of water that swung along the deck. It
seemed as though his arm would be torn from
its socket: his face was stung and flailed by
spume and great gouts of hard-flung water.</p>
<p>He braced and clung as the washing water
swung Henry along: the check of his clutch
slowed Henry&rsquo;s body and Tom&rsquo;s arms ached
with the pull. He dared not let go until the
wave should pass. Henry, caught off his guard,
and with his brain befuddled, was helpless.</p>
<p>Came the thud of the companion door as Mr.
Gray slammed it shut in bare time to prevent
the cabin from being inundated.</p>
<p>From the wheelhouse door, now beyond the
higher wash of the receding water, Bill leaped,
with Cliff at his heels, Nicky clinging madly to
the spokes of the wheel and fighting to hold the
cruiser on her way, nose to wind and wave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Gripping every foot and hand hold, Bill and
Cliff fought through the swirl of water, while
Tom clung grimly. The water receded and
Henry was dumped, inert and gasping, onto the
deck just as the hold Tom had was broken by
the strain. Swiftly Bill grasped Henry&rsquo;s
shoulder and began to drag him toward the
cabin companionway, while Cliff caught Tom
and steadied him.</p>
<p>Another huge wave was rearing its white curl
to the quarter. In the wheelhouse Nicky, a little
frightened at his responsibility, and yet manfully
rising to the occasion, knew that the boat
must not be allowed to pay off so that she
would catch the waves on her side&mdash;she would
be rolled over, and over. He bore with his whole
weight on the spokes, holding the rudder hard
over as the valiant craft struggled against the
rush of waters and the roar of the swiftly rising
wind.</p>
<p>With Cliff aiding him, while Bill dragged at
the gasping Henry, Tom got to the cabin. His
father opened the door, and all three grasped
Henry and fairly flung him in through the door
and down the several steps. Then in they
plunged, and just in time to close the door before
the tumult of water was over the decks
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The brave little vessel shuddered and
groaned under the water, and Nicky said a little
prayer for strength to hold the wheel against
his enemies of wave and rushing air. Tom
sputtered and got rid of some water he had
taken in, while Henry, sitting up, gulping and
choking, began to thank him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saved my&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>Totally unconscious that he was taking the
command, or that his words rang with the authority
of anger and just censure, Tom cried,
&ldquo;Never mind. Get yourself together and get
to that wheel. Nicky&rsquo;s alone there. Joe&rsquo;s calling.
Cliff, go help Joe. Bill, you drag this
Henry up to that wheel and stand over him.
Cliff&rsquo;s father is battening down the ports.
We&rsquo;re all safe inside, but we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s
going to happen. Get going, you Henry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if every one of them recognized the voice
of command, Bill caught Henry&rsquo;s collar and almost
yanked him to his feet. Henry, sobered
and now beginning to recover himself, and with
the just rebuke and the evident menace of their
position clearing his mind, obediently staggered
along with Bill, while Cliff raced past them on
the other side of the churning, coughing engine,
to help Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do, Tom?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gray,
thrusting home a heavy steel bar across the
companion door, although, being aft, it was not
subjected to the crushing force of the waves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find that Henry Morgan&rsquo;s &lsquo;tonic,&rsquo; if it&rsquo;s
my last act!&rdquo; cried Tom and began flinging
things out of the lazarette, or storage cubby
in the floor, where their food was kept.</p>
<p>He had no success there, but he began on the
bunks lining the sides of the long, low, narrow
cabin, at whose forward end was the wheel,
with the engines just a little aft of amidships.</p>
<p>Still the storm, sudden and furious, mounted
in ferocity. The vessel plunged and reared,
rolled and twisted; her timbers creaked and
her decks echoed to the roar and thunder of
waves. Cliff and &ldquo;Andy&rdquo; stuck, one on either
side of the motor, oiling, wiping, Andy watching
the gasoline pressure glass, and the oil
flow, Cliff jumping, clinging to the bunks, to
bring a rag, or to steady Andy while he made
an adjustment of the carbureter to compensate
for the slight and occasional &ldquo;miss&rdquo; in one
cylinder.</p>
<p>Forward, Bill, Nicky and Henry clung to the
wheel, all swinging together at Henry&rsquo;s order,
or releasing a spoke or two to pay off for more
way between the great, onrushing combers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we close in, yet?&rdquo; gasped Nicky, half
out of breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Henry, between his teeth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to swing her around if I can get steerage
way in some minute when it&rsquo;s quieter&mdash;we&rsquo;d
better run before it&mdash;but I das&rsquo;sent try now&mdash;&rsquo;cause why?
She&rsquo;d roll like a barrel and maybe
dive under!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A drop of oil on that propeller shaft bearing,&rdquo;
shouted Andy to Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; cried Cliff, above the thud of water
and the groan of the timbers and the thrashing
pulsation of the propeller, racing as it was
lifted from the surging water. &ldquo;Ease her when
she races, Andy,&rdquo; but he knew that Andy did
so before his young aide spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could get a chance to swing her
around,&rdquo; choked out Henry, a thoroughly sober
and frightened man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold her as she is,&rdquo; Nicky urged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
wild to turn here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; exulted Tom, rising from an
old airtight waste can, bolted down aft of the
engine; it had been filled with oily waste and
old wiping rags, and he had found, at the bottom,
the bottles Henry had concealed there.
&ldquo;Mr. Gray&mdash;don&rsquo;t say a word. I&rsquo;ll put them
back until this storm blows by and then I&rsquo;ll
break them on the rocks when we get in to
shore.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>With the suddenness which characterizes
tropical storms of certain sorts, less than hurricanes,
the wind began to drop, and soon to fall
to the steady trade wind velocity, while the
clouds broke, the rain squalls ceased, blue sky
appeared, and only the lifting heave of the turbulent
Caribbean remained of the time of stress.
They all breathed a sigh of relief; but the respite
was brief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re closer in than I thought!&rdquo; shouted
Henry, at the wheel. &ldquo;Quick, somebody, get
forward with the lead. Half-speed, Andy! We
may be close on a reef!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom flung aside the brace of the after door,
and with Nicky at his side, leaped on deck
while Mr. Gray closed the door. Bill was already
out of the side door to port, while Andy
and Cliff stood by their engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reverse&mdash;back water!&rdquo; cried Henry.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to fight her off the shore and stand
off and on until we can see what we&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same minute came an agonized cry
from Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Port&mdash;port&mdash;hard a-port! Rocks dead
ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry flung his weight on the small wheel.
Over it swung.</p>
<p>Before their bow, disclosed by an onrushing
comber which had obscured them, great black
fangs of rock held their bared teeth in readiness
to crunch joyously, grimly, as the <i>Porto
Bello</i> staggered and strove to claw around!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">STRANDED!</span></h2>
<p>Gleaming and flashing like the huge tusks
of a water wolf, waiting, submerged, to gnash
upon the defenseless cruiser, Tom saw the
rocks, great needles of terror, for only an instant.
Then a great, great, green-blue wave
lifted between his straining eyes and the
danger.</p>
<p>The wave swept on, while under their keel,
another equally huge mass of water bellied up
and flung the boat aloft on its surface.</p>
<p>Slowly the bow swung. The next glimpse Tom
caught of the menace, it was off to port&mdash;but
did a range of submerged reefs extend far
across their path? Tom pointed out the threat
to Bill and Nicky. They gasped, so close was
the nearer of the needles.</p>
<p>All along the coast of Central America these
reefs and islands, huge barrier reefs, wide, low-lying
circle reefs, atolls enclosing tiny islets&mdash;all
are a menace to navigation, and it is a skillful
pilot who will try to take a boat in among
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Henry Morgan was not a skillful pilot, but
he had been through the barriers about the Rio
Patuca mouth many times and he felt sure of
his ability, coupled with an abiding faith in his
&ldquo;luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just after a storm, and with the seas
even more wild than was their usual turbulent
state, the task of getting through the reefs was
one to whiten his face and shake his very marrow.
Bill, looking back, saw his face of terror
and, with a word to the boys, scrambled to the
cabin and snatched the wheel from fingers already
nerveless with fear. But the boat had
paid off, the signal for full speed ahead had
been obeyed, the steerageway, aided by the
surge and force of the waves, had enabled them
to turn aside. They swept over the first barrier
on a huge swinging crest, seeing, through
the clear water, that the jaws of rock seemed
to gnash in fury at the loss of their prey. Tom
and Nicky, gripping the capstan with one hand
each, clutched one another with the other, clinging
in tense, breathless waiting.</p>
<p>But the boat did not strike. She missed the
rocks by almost a miracle. Had Henry kept his
senses earlier in the voyage he would hardly
have exposed them to such peril. For it was
not over; it had scarcely begun!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t only the rocks,&rdquo; Nicky shrilled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;sharks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still,&rdquo; Tom called back, squeezing
Nicky&rsquo;s arm reassuringly. &ldquo;Watch to the fore
and on your side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the swirl in the
water just ahead, and on the triangular black
fin to port than on his duty, and it was fortunate
that no rock loomed near his post; the
sharks were gathering with seemingly uncanny
instinct, waiting&mdash;waiting&mdash;waiting!</p>
<p>Bill, once the menace of the outer reef was
passed, swung the bow down the coast, and because
the most powerful thrust of the waves
had been subdued, although they still were big
enough to roll the cruiser sickeningly, they were
able to make headway, always fighting outward
a few points to overcome the inswing of the
water.</p>
<p>Along the coast Tom and Nicky could see
low, sandy stretches of beach, under the broil
of the sun, now full out and very hot; beyond
the wide strips of sand there were dense,
tangled masses of jungle, and even in the
cleared air after the storm they could scent
that queer, fetid odor of decaying vegetation
and mold which is characteristic of the tropics.
Far in the distance, landward, back of sand
and jungle, bluish mountains loomed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we heading for?&rdquo; Nicky wondered,
and Tom shook his head. &ldquo;I hope Henry
knows,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any opening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor, at the moment, did Henry, who, thoroughly
subdued, but with a remnant of his former
manhood forcing him to steel his nerves to
save his own precious life, and theirs, came
forward and stood, eyes roving the shore and
the waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are those big waves?&rdquo; Nicky asked,
pointing shoreward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shifting sand banks,&rdquo; Henry replied huskily.
&ldquo;They always change. If we once get
aground there, the waves would pound the boat
to a pulp! And&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo; He felt a kick from
Tom, and, with a glance of surprise, saw Tom&rsquo;s
eyes warning him not to frighten Nicky.</p>
<p>Tom, himself no coward, had sometimes
yielded to a nameless dread of things unseen,
but any visible danger tightened his muscles to
their athletic perfection, settled his nerves and
steadied his whole body to its dominating
mind&rsquo;s demands. He knew Nicky was not a
coward, but he also knew that for anybody&rsquo;s
mind to settle on fear and think about it and
worry about it, made them helpless when the
need for action came.</p>
<p>For once Henry took a hint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Cliff, with the tense moment at the engines
over, came on deck and joined his chums for a
breath of the heated, but fresher air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are shifting sandbanks,&rdquo; Tom explained,
pointing. &ldquo;We are hunting for the
channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Brower&rsquo;s Inlet, that place inshore,&rdquo;
Henry said. &ldquo;Now, form a line to pass word
quick to Bill how to steer, and you, Cliff, be by
the engine room port to call directions&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
try for the shore&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t guarantee&mdash;&rdquo;
Tom kicked his shins again and Henry, scowling,
became still and intent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, peering hard, Henry called his orders
and the chums relayed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swing her head to that swirl of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around came the bow till the wind was from
directly aft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full speed ahead!&rdquo; And the engine picked
up its heavy thud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ease her off a point to port. Slow down
to quarter speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toward land the great rollers, muddy and
moiled, rose into swirling lines of dirty foam,
then drew off to the shore.</p>
<p>Seaward, greater combers reared their heads
and growled their fury that they had not succeeded
in flinging these daring people onto their
fang-like reefs.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence&mdash;of quiet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Then came a sort of sighing, from the waves,
as the <i>Porto Bello</i> swung her nose among them.
She rose up over a wave, then settled; there
came a trembling and a dragging as the bottom
grated on the sand. She wrenched and
tore herself free, like a living thing striving to
help her friends at wheel and engine.</p>
<p>A great wave came rolling, its speed seeming
to threaten that it would roar down upon
the boat, her own speed diminished by the friction
of her keel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re&mdash;we&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo; Henry began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No we&rsquo;re not! We&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; shrilled Tom as
the wave caught up to them and the <i>Porto
Bello</i>, with a staggering effort, let herself be
swung up into the cradling arms of the mighty
water.</p>
<p>She staggered on; she lost the supporting
force of the water and sunk down on one side;
once again&mdash;and ever again for what seemed
an eternity, she was lifted, borne forward,
slumped down to roar and grind along the sand,
or to lie, like a stricken thing, on her bulging
side, the sole thing that kept her from turning
over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Bill did noble work, with Cliff again at his
side, at the wheel, while Nicky and Tom stood
by at the bows, one with the lead held ready
if they ever got through this moiling mud and
spume.</p>
<p>Came a wave, the greatest yet, as the <i>Porto
Bello</i> was dumped on the sand. Crash! while
they all grabbed and clung to stanchions with
all their strength a huge swirl of muddied
water swept over them. They emerged, gasping
and coughing&mdash;came another grinding, forward
movement&mdash;and then, like a tired bird,
safe at last in her nest, the cruiser slid over
the last sand of the bar and into quiet water
where, as her engine slowed, she rocked in a
soft, gentle swell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; coughed Bill, poking out a porthole
glass, and sticking his head out through the
opening. &ldquo;That was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand by!&rdquo; shouted Henry, wildly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
in a current running back out to sea like a
torrent&mdash;get her around&mdash;get her around&mdash;hard
a-starboar&mdash;no, hard a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simultaneously he broke off his calls and
stared ahead as if chained to the spot, speechless.
Tom and Nicky, staring too, stiffened.</p>
<p>Out from the sand protruded needles of rock,
with swirling water and roiling sand partly concealing
the black doom!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back water!&rdquo; yelled Cliff. &ldquo;Swing her off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;forward&mdash;full speed ahead!&rdquo; cried
Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Henry had sunk down and covered his eyes
from the vision of the black-finned monsters
congregating in the muddy waters&mdash;sharks!</p>
<p>Bill had the tiller ropes roaring in their channel,
for he had paid no heed to the conflicting
orders but, with a little prayer of devout trust
that he did not mention later, he stood, gripping
the spokes.</p>
<p>The boat had lost way, and swung sideways
across the rushing water. Tom saw what was
coming. Instantly he snatched loose a life preserver!
Not to leap and save his life. To save
all of them!</p>
<p>He bent low, hanging over the bow, dropping
the preserver so that it met the rock, was
between it and the boat as she touched.</p>
<p>She shuddered, and there was a crunch, but
no smash. Madly yelling for full speed astern,
Bill pawed his wheel over; the boat hesitated,
her back-lashed propeller striving against the
stream; slowly she receded from the rocks. Tom
released his clutch on the preserver rope; from
aft came the grind and shiver of sickening contact;
the engine grated to a stop with a jar
and a cough. The boat shuddered, ran forward
again in the current.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The propeller hit!&rdquo; shouted Cliff, from the
after deck, staring overside at a wicked fang,
seeming to lick its glistening lips at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably bent beyond help!&rdquo; called
Andy, from the engine. &ldquo;The gears in the shift
box are stripped. When the propeller caught
it tore the gear teeth off&mdash;lucky it didn&rsquo;t crack
the crankshaft!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have no power,&rdquo; ruefully Bill called.</p>
<p>There was no use for it, had they possessed
it. With the strong outsweep of the water, and
with a low, sandy spit jutting before them,
there was nothing to be done but wait.</p>
<p>Gently, almost at the inlet, the <i>Porto Bello</i>
lifted her nose on a swell, and poked it experimentally
into the sand.</p>
<p>She liked the soft bed, burrowed forward on
the next low swell, and then settled down, like
a baby in its cradle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may thank goodness for being here,&rdquo;
cried Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad&mdash;to be stranded?&rdquo; demurred
Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better here than&mdash;out there!&rdquo; Tom waved
his arm toward the roaring surf of the outer
reef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nicky agreed, then, ruefully, he added,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;re stranded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless it&rsquo;s quicksand, we&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; Tom
declared. &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s low tide we can examine
the propeller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we get off?&rdquo; urged Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take one thing at a time&mdash;and take
it as it comes!&rdquo; said Tom. And Mr. Gray, somewhat
shaken, but very calm, as well as Bill,
agreed with Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">TURTLES AND TROUBLE</span></h2>
<p>Notwithstanding the youthful efforts to be
optimistic, the <i>Porto Bello&rsquo;s</i> position was bad.
She lay with her stern in deeper, swift water.
Sharks and the rapid flow of the tide made it
impossible to get under her stern to examine
the propeller. They had spare parts, and would
be able to repair the stripped gearing, or, at
least, to render the clutch and shifts possible
to use by substituting new gears. But the damage
to the propeller must be estimated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea,&rdquo; said Tom, with proper diffidence,
when the entire party discussed the situation
while they ate the dinner Bill prepared, &ldquo;my
idea would be to get a rope over to those snags
of rock, put pulleys fore and aft on the top of
the cabin, reave a rope through them, run it
to the capstan, forward, then carry it out to
the snags, fasten it, and then, steadily take up
on it with the winch. The pull would work on
the whole boat that way, and if we moved most
of our stuff aft and lightened the bow, she
might drag off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;How would we get a line to those snags&mdash;across
that deep water?&rdquo; objected Henry. &ldquo;I,
for one, won&rsquo;t risk those sharks! They say
they don&rsquo;t trouble the Indians, or Negroes, but
white men are different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably Indians will come out in canoes,&rdquo;
Tom said hopefully.</p>
<p>This prediction proved true, but not until
the next morning; then a canoe containing two
stolid Mosquito Indians came out. They wore
ragged trousers and shirts worn outside the
trousers, hanging down, and their dark faces
were almost as expressionless as those of the
North American Indians.</p>
<p>They paddled down the water near the stern,
and coming into a small bight of water where
the current was less violent, they sat still for
almost an hour, staring fixedly and without answering
a number of hails sent them by various
ones.</p>
<p>Finally, however, they did respond. They
spoke little, but seemed to comprehend a little
English and a trifle more of Spanish. Henry
Morgan, who was morose and angry about
something, bellowed orders at them. Tom, who
knew what made Henry sour, since Tom had already
dropped several fat bottles into a swift
eddy astern, remonstrated at his angry commands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t like to be yelled at,&rdquo; Tom said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be still!&rdquo; snapped Henry. &ldquo;I guess I
know how to handle these Indians. You&rsquo;ve got
to bellow and roar at them to get them started.
They&rsquo;re lazy and they&rsquo;re rough and they&rsquo;d
never move if you don&rsquo;t get them waked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be all that,&rdquo; agreed Tom, &ldquo;but
they&rsquo;re human, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry walked away.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Tom&rsquo;s way proved the better
one, for when Bill held up a flashing bit of
ornamental glass, like the crystal pendant from
a glass chandelier, they spoke. In time they
were induced to catch a rope and carry it out
and, in the canoe, fix it fast to a projecting
tooth of rock located in the proper direction
to help pull the boat out of her sand bed, into
which she was burrowing her nose more deeply
with every roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll use the rocks that tried to injure us,
and make them help us!&rdquo; Cliff cried, and with
a good will they took up slack on the rope until
it was taut and throbbing with its tension.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>After a long day of effort and patience they
saw their craft float free, and, for another bribe,
several more Indians were procured, in canoes,
to tow them to a convenient beach where their
rope was taken well inland to a coco-palm, secured
there, and the boat was unloaded the next
day, the stuff piled on the hot sand under an
improvised shelter of canvas stretched over
four upright pieces of timber found by the
chums in a search of the beach.</p>
<p>Under another shelter, to which they brought
heavy mosquito netting and with it made a tight
enclosure, they spent the night. It was no pleasant
slumber that came to them, for the Central
American mosquitos are not only vicious and
persistent, but they are large and their bite, on
any but the toughest skin, produces red welts
and a sort of itching that is as maddening as it
is persistent and painful.</p>
<p>The next day, while Bill and Henry bargained
with the Indians for canoes and guides
to take them up the Rio Patuca to a tribe
further inland where the old Indian, Toosa,
lived, and while Cliff and Mr. Gray aided Andy
in work of examining the gear and shafting,
Nicky joined Tom on the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the Indians are going turtle hunting,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s us go along. They&rsquo;ll take
us. I let one young Indian play with my watch,
and he promised to take us if I let him wear the
watch during the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>They accordingly joined the Indians. The
method of hunting was interesting: they went
along the beach and, watching until they saw a
turtle sunning itself, or, possibly, laying its
eggs, they managed to get between it and the
water.</p>
<p>Sometimes they were not adroit enough. A
turtle will instinctively try for its native element,
and once in it, no expert can capture it.
On land, however, once headed off, it may be
turned on its back, and thus secured. After
several wasted tries they managed to get a big
fellow, weighing several hundred pounds,
headed off and surrounded.</p>
<p>It was both a job and a tussle to get the
huge and clumsy shell reversed; and then the
boys were amazed at the cleverness of the Indians&rsquo;
method of getting the creature back to
their village, or near to it. To drag such a
weight would be very hard. To make it &ldquo;do
its own driving&rdquo; as Tom said, was the easier
way. The Indians fastened ropes to each of
its flippers, and then turned it over.</p>
<p>With slackened ropes, the creature instantly
drove for the water. But once it plunged into
its favorite retreat, the ropes were manipulated
in such a way that the animal was actually made
to swim and, in addition, was pulled, along the
shore line, with comparatively little effort. Once
opposite the camp, the turtle was dragged onto
the beach and despatched, to be cut into choice
portions. For their efforts during the hunt,
Tom and Nicky were given some large chunks
of the meat which made a wonderful addition
to eggs they had discovered, and their regular
fare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Days passed with little happening. Outside
of the tedious work of dismantling the gear assembly,
and taking out the propeller shaft and
bearings to be certain that all was sound, and
hammering at the propeller to get its bent
flanges back to proper pitch, there was only
eating, fighting mosquitos and other annoying
insects, and trying to be patient.</p>
<p>In spite of, or, maybe, because of Henry&rsquo;s
shouts and orders, the Indians made no move
to take the party upstream.</p>
<p>It was only when the combined arguments of
Mr. Gray, Bill, Tom and his chums made Henry
desist, that finally, after about ten days, the
Indians signified that on the morrow two canoes
would start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill, and Henry will go, of course,&rdquo; said
Mr. Gray. &ldquo;Tom, I feel, has a right to be with
them because of his intense interest in any
news concerning his sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Nicky is all bitten up with&mdash;or by&mdash;mosquitos,&rdquo;
said Cliff, &ldquo;and he can&rsquo;t risk getting
away from the ointment jars&mdash;and I must
help with the readjustment of the engine and
stay with Andy and Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>It was arranged in that way. The next morning
two canoes came to the beach and Bill and
Tom climbed into the larger, while Henry took
his place in the smaller one. With many farewell
waves, and promises to get back as quickly
as the information could be discovered, they
were rowed&mdash;or paddled&mdash;away.</p>
<p>In turning the sand-spit into the inlet&rsquo;s swift
current, the canoe containing Henry, still
morose and soured, went fairly near the jagged
rock formation on which the propeller had been
damaged. Through the clear water, as a swirl of
mud settled, he caught sight of something, and
with a sharp word, ordered the four Indians
paddling to swing in closer. He got very close
to the rock, leaned over the side, then jumped
into the water up to his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo; demanded
Bill in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; whispered Tom, &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d broken
the darn things. I did try to shy the bottles
of his &lsquo;tonic&rsquo; so they&rsquo;d smash, but they
missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Henry had discovered them. More, he
recovered them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where they went!&rdquo; he cried furiously
red, holding the fat bottles aloft and shaking
them toward the other boat. &ldquo;Which one
of that boatful did that&mdash;threw my stuff away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Suddenly he turned on Tom, about twenty
feet away, in the larger canoe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you&mdash;&rdquo;
he snarled, &ldquo;you was the one. &rsquo;Cause why?
&rsquo;Cause you was hollerin&rsquo; about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s face turned red. Henry saw it and,
in his sudden rage, he drew back his arm and
flung one of the flasks&mdash;or almost did!</p>
<p>With Henry&rsquo;s arm at the point of coming
forward, Bill, a marksman of no mean ability,
caught up the rifle with which he had armed
himself, and almost at the instant that it appeared
above the gunwale, there came the spit
of its bullet and the shivering of glass as the
bottle broke in Henry&rsquo;s hand. So close was
the shot, so perfect the aim, that only the neck
of the bottle remained.</p>
<p>Henry dropped it, staring in rage and disappointment
at the roiling spot where his good
&ldquo;tonic&rdquo; was blending swiftly with the Caribbean
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop that other one!&rdquo; snapped Bill.</p>
<p>Henry did so&mdash;but into the canoe; and, so
furious and beyond reason was he that his hand
groped for and brought out his own rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You drop that rifle,&rdquo; snapped Bill. &ldquo;You
crazy coot! Don&rsquo;t you know I mean business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled Henry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the drop
on me&mdash;just now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The way he replaced the rifle and climbed
into the tilting canoe, as well as the tone in
which his husky words were spoken, indicated
that this was only one time, that there would be
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn back,&rdquo; suggested Tom, dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Forget his crazy stunt!&rdquo; urged Bill.
&ldquo;Any day that I can&rsquo;t handle a loon like him,
I&rsquo;ll eat scorpions&rsquo; tails!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he gets so angry!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;And
he&rsquo;s got a bottle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting angry is better for us&mdash;as long as
we keep cool!&rdquo; Bill grinned, his rifle lazily resting
on the canoe&rsquo;s edge. &ldquo;A cool man can out-guess,
out-plan, out-shoot a fellow in a temper,
any day! As for that bottle&mdash;watch it splinter
the first time it starts for his lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill motioned to the Indians, who had hardly
moved, and who had certainly not spoken or
changed expression. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he said. Tom
thought that just a hint of admiration showed
in the faces of the five paddling their own craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you saved his life on the boat, when
that wave washed him down,&rdquo; grunted Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d do it again!&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>Little he guessed how prophetic his words
would prove to be!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">AN UNPLEASANT TRIP</span></h2>
<p>That trip up the Rio Patuca was one of the
worst experiences Tom had ever been through,
and Bill agreed with him when he said so.</p>
<p>Starting through a narrow inlet, taking advantage
of the inflow of the tide, the canoes
came into a lagoon; the water was shallow but
clear; the banks were lined with the most dense
and varied vegetation imaginable; Tom could
recognize at a distance, only the cocoanut
palms, and the mangroves, with their huge,
spreading roots.</p>
<p>The canoes proceeded up the lagoon to a native
village, marked by a cluster of coco-palms
which seemed to be floating in the water. The
whole village turned out to watch the landing of
the white men and their young companion and
Tom saw that they were as curious about him
as he was about them. The young men were
clean-limbed and had very fine faces; the girls
were almost beautiful, though the older women
showed how labor and daily toil aged and furrowed
their faces and bent their bodies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>After a stay overnight the canoes set out
again, and day after day the routine of paddling,
fighting mosquitos, landing for lunch, going
forward, finding a place to camp, putting
up mosquito bars and trying to prevent them
from being filled by the pests before it was too
late, was all there was to report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly named this country well,&rdquo;
Tom told Bill as they dived under their
mosquito netting on the second day of the trip.</p>
<p>The mosquitos were much larger than the
Northern species, and were of such a tough,
rubbery body that in order to destroy them it
was necessary to strike ones-self with great
force&mdash;&ldquo;More punishment than relief!&rdquo; Tom observed,
ruefully, as he fought the pests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have to be killed,&rdquo; replied Bill, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ll have to get our net up earlier at night, because
they get worse as we go on, Henry says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tom admitted. &ldquo;He told me that if
anybody stayed out from the protection of his
net for an hour at night, he&rsquo;d be bitten to
death!&rdquo; Bill agreed that it was quite probable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>As they went on, finally reaching and turning
into the muddy mouth of the river itself
through a narrow channel, Tom and Bill came
to the conclusion that their trip had more difficulties
in store than the pestilence of the country&rsquo;s
terrible mosquitos. Henry Morgan kept
away from them, morose and sullen; when he
caught Henry&rsquo;s eyes bent on him, or on Bill,
Tom saw that they were brooding and angry.
Henry had long since disposed of his final bottle
of &ldquo;tonic,&rdquo; and he seemed to be holding and
feeding his grudge against Bill and Tom for
destroying the other bottle.</p>
<p>He was very hard on his Indians. He yelled
at them, drove them, said foul things to them
and about them. Tom and Bill, on the contrary,
were decent in their attitudes; and, although
the Indians were stolid and silent, seldom speaking,
almost never smiling, they showed, in little
services, that were human and responsive under
their stolid exteriors. They often put up Tom&rsquo;s
mosquito bar for him, gave him and his closer
companion the best they had, but always without
the least flicker of expression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Henry had to demand help, had to drive and
threaten to get anything done; Tom had only
to wish for an adjustment of his sleeping couch,
of boughs, in a rude camp&mdash;and it was done!
Perhaps it was because, during the long, humid,
tensely hot days, he took the trouble to see that
the heavy bough with which he fought mosquitos
was used to drive them away from the
paddlers as well; also, because he and Bill
shared their food when the Indians had little.
There seemed to be no open appreciation, but
gratitude was evident in many ways, although
Henry, seeing them wave their branches to flick
the mosquitos from the Indians&rsquo; backs, derided
them and sneered, saying an Indian had no feelings.</p>
<p>Camping on mud banks, uncomfortable and
mean, paddling through muddy waters, past
vast jungles and wide, low savannas of lush
grass, past wide cane-brakes, they pursued slow
but steady, if tedious progress. Tom began to
wish the trip were done. Rain, fog and wet,
dreary days were far more frequent than dry
ones; and this, added to the mud beneath their
camps, the small food supply and the mean
temper of Morgan, made things more than unpleasant.</p>
<p>In time they reached a small village; the huts
were of palmetto stakes, driven into the ground
close together, in the shape of an oblong enclosure
with rounded ends and a space for a
door; roofs were of a thatch of woven reeds
or brush. The few Indians were silent, stolid
people, but not unkind or cruel in their attitude.
At this village, Bill and Henry were informed,
they would be left until men came
down the river to take them on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they know we&rsquo;re here&mdash;and in a hurry?&rdquo;
ventured Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>The canoeman looked blank and said little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know,&rdquo; Morgan responded in surly,
husky tones. &ldquo;Indians know when people
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do they know?&rdquo; Tom persisted. &ldquo;Do
they send messengers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know!&rdquo; snapped Henry and turned
away.</p>
<p>Tom made no comment on the rude behavior,
but busied himself making friends with a small
boy, evidently a child belonging to some one
of importance. The youngster, about eight,
liked the white boy, some years older, and when
his shyness was overcome, he spent hours
watching Tom as the white youth demonstrated
how a small, bright red magnet he carried would
draw and cling to several nails he also had.</p>
<p>The boy, Porfirio, in response, showed Tom
many trails across the swamp savannas surrounding
the village, and helped him to search
for beautiful tropical birds&rsquo; eggs, curious
stones, and other specimens. Always he begged
to be shown the magnet and its power; it fascinated
him and, the day that Tom let him,
fearfully and timidly, take it and play with
it for a while, he looked toward Tom as one
might have looked at a master, and from then
on, followed him like a dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>By that time Tom had picked up enough of
the village dialect to learn that Porfirio&rsquo;s
father had been slain by one of the jaguars&mdash;or,
as the natives termed the ferocious cats,
tigers, caught on a lonely trail without a
weapon, and horribly mangled. Tom felt sorry
for the desolate child and did his best to amuse
him.</p>
<p>After several wasted weeks, a great canoe
arrived from upriver, in which, besides the
paddlers, was an old man, bent and wizened
and terribly dwarfed; yet he was stronger than
any other man&mdash;or any two men&mdash;among the
Indians, and seemed to be greatly respected.
He was Toosa, the man they had come so far
to see!</p>
<p>Henry at once began to question him, but
Toosa paid no heed to him at all. He had
come, primarily, to take the child, Porfirio, a
great-grandson, to his own village further up
the turbid stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came all the way up here&mdash;you recognize
me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Henry cried, and when
the old man nodded, went on, &ldquo;we came all the
way to find out where&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Toosa made a gesture, stopping Henry. He
had just landed and his young great-grandson
ran to greet him. Toosa merely touched his
shoulder with a finger and turned back toward
the boats after a brief word with one of the
natives. But Henry caught his thin, though
muscular and wiry arm. Tom, watching, saw a
display of a curious power that the old man
possessed. He did not move his body or shake
Henry off; he simply turned his head and fixed
his steady, bright eyes on the impatient white
man. Henry, about to speak, seemed to be
struck by some invisible message of power, for
he closed his lips, holding the grip he had for a
moment; then his hand loosened and dropped,
and he stood still. Toosa, turning back toward
the boats, resumed his way, the small boy trotting
at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to let him get away, though,
at that,&rdquo; demurred Tom, but Bill merely gave
him a warning glance, and slowly strolled along
behind the dwarfed, bent old figure. Henry,
after a moment, took up the march, and Tom
kept close to Bill, curious and uncertain what
was to happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a powerful chief, even if he isn&rsquo;t the
magician that the Indians think he is,&rdquo; Bill
observed quietly to Tom. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t talk to
us until he has settled himself in his own village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will we get there?&rdquo; Tom wondered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>He soon found out. As soon as he had settled
himself in his great, roughly shaped canoe,
made from the trunk of a huge tree, Toosa
turned to the three whites on the bank, and
beckoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take us?&rdquo; asked Bill in slow English.
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you expect us?&rdquo; asked Tom, mystified
at the Indian&rsquo;s calm arrangements for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; answered the old man briefly, and
said no more. As they took their designated
positions the chief took a paddle several times
heavier and broader than the rest, made a signal,
and the canoe began to glide away from
the Indians, watching on the bank.</p>
<p>That huge paddle served well during the trip
up the river, and the amazing strength with
which the wiry old man used it was a marvel
to Tom. There were rapids, and dangerous
ones they proved to be. The swift water almost
carried the canoe back, but with a strong sweep
of that great driver, the Indian caused it to
tremble; with a second heave, while the other
Indians strove with their smaller paddles, he
sent the boat forward, and then guided and
drove it between the rocks, over the rough
waters, past dangerous whirlpools. Once, only
a swift swing of his paddle turned them aside
before they were dashed to death in a whirling
smother of foaming waters. Again, by exertions
that seemed akin to those of a giant, he
took the craft forward when one of the lighter
paddles broke and the crew was in confusion
and terror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>And when, close to nightfall, they landed, he
stepped from the canoe as serene and unwearied
as if he had been one of the three
white passengers. Tom heard from Bill that
the oldest Indians in that country claimed that
Toosa lived there and was just as they saw him
today, when the Indians themselves had been
children.</p>
<p>Quartered in a hut, fed and well cared for,
at least two of the white travelers obeyed
Toosa&rsquo;s brief order, which Bill understood to
be a command that they must not set foot outside
the hut. The reason for it seemed plain.
It was a precaution against danger. During
Toosa&rsquo;s absence many of the villagers had become
demons through drinking the fermented
cane-juice which was brewed in a huge trough
in the village and from which much had been
taken.</p>
<p>The Indians were not only noisy and, in
some cases, quarrelsome; they were beyond control.</p>
<p>In spite of their remonstrances Henry Morgan
elbowed his way past Tom and Bill, his
rifle under his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going out to mix with them and join
in their orgies!&rdquo; cried Bill. &ldquo;I hope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows them. He&rsquo;s been here often, he
says,&rdquo; Tom reminded him, &ldquo;he isn&rsquo;t in any
danger.&rdquo; Bill shook his head. He was not
convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not him I&rsquo;m worrying about, or what
they&rsquo;ll do to him,&rdquo; he said moodily, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s what
he may tell them about us&mdash;remember, he&rsquo;s
nursing a grudge against us, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;That&mdash;and cane-juice&mdash;make
a bad pair!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">MAGIC AND MADNESS</span></h2>
<p>In the midst of a tropical paradise under
the vivid moon, and with the looming grandeur
of brooding mountains over it, Tom and Bill
saw such an orgy of lust and degradation as
made them shudder.</p>
<p>Around the rude receptacle which held the
fermented cane-juice, the Indians gathered. The
younger men and the older youths played a
weird, tuneless melody on reed pipes while the
others indulged their taste for the strong
liquid. Henry Morgan joined these and seemed
to be a member of long standing, by the greetings
he got.</p>
<p>Out into the moonlit square of the village, a
space where the earth was trodden by countless
feet until it was almost as hard as stone, came
a bent, but striking figure. Although age had
almost drawn his nose and chin together,
although his body was in no way erect or
striking, Tom saw nothing grotesque in that
stalking form; rather, it spoke of power and
of virility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Toosa was a figure of force in his rage!</p>
<p>He approached the trough and for a while,
as though ashamed, or frightened, the men were
very still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he stop them, do you suppose?&rdquo; Tom
whispered, to Bill, as the two crouched by the
door of the large hut that had been assigned to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a lot of influence over them,&rdquo; replied
his companion.</p>
<p>They watched, silent and amazed as Toosa
stalked straight over to the group of Indians.
The reeds ceased to whine and whistle. The
younger men and the boys appeared to fade
into the encircling brush.</p>
<p>Toosa simply stood there, his distorted body
drawn as erect as was possible, arms folded,
his face stern in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Toosa spoke no word.</p>
<p>There was a long moment of absolute silence.
Toosa looked at his tribesmen and they,
shamed, looked down at the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Only Henry Morgan, his ruddy face inflamed,
his eyes more bleary than ever, stared boldly
back at the dark-skinned nemesis. Toosa did
not even glance toward the white man; his regard
was fixed upon his own kind. Several of
them shifted their positions nervously and one,
sidling off with head averted, disappearing into
the brush.</p>
<p>That seemed to be the signal. Still Toosa
said nothing&mdash;he merely looked his anger and
disgust. But the men began to move, restlessly
and then hurriedly rising and starting
in various directions, none going near Toosa
except one careless individual. With a swift,
unexpected sweep of his ape-like arm, Toosa
touched that man&mdash;and he sprawled in a
choking, gasping heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look at Henry!&rdquo; whispered Tom,
gripping Bill&rsquo;s shoulder hard in his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was afraid of,&rdquo; Bill whispered
back. &ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t think about us&mdash;I can
guess that he&rsquo;s going to defy Toosa! If he can
get the Indians back he may turn their attention
on us&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not say any more, but his hand
tightened on the stock of his rifle and with the
other he loosened one of his two pistols, worn
in belt holsters, and glanced at Tom in the
dim light. Tom was too intent on the scene
in the square to observe Bill&rsquo;s half intent to
give him a weapon which, did need arise, Tom&rsquo;s
training during the trip would enable him to use
effectively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Henry, his muscles responding poorly to his
befuddled will, staggered upright and, wavering
a little, faced Toosa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;What do you
mean, you red dog, by interfering with a white
man&rsquo;s pleasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Tom asked as Toosa
made a curt response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to the effect that the white man&rsquo;s
&lsquo;pleasure&rsquo; was the Indians&rsquo; ruin!&rdquo; Bill told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, too,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with Toosa,
all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry was not with Toosa, but very much
against him! He stood, shakily but with fury
growing in his face, a white man of the lowest
sort, in maudlin rage defying a red man of the
higher type of intelligence. It passed through
Tom&rsquo;s mind that by comparison, the red man
was the finer specimen, dwarf or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach&mdash;teach you&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo; gulped Henry,
and he bent down for his rifle, lying on the
ground.</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s muscles tensed, and he was about to
leap forward, his own weapon ready; but Tom
held his arm, and whispered, &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; began Bill, but what transpired
caused him to hesitate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Toosa, standing without movement or change
of expression, watched as Henry fumbled with
his gun, and getting himself erect by an effort,
tried to level the rifle at Toosa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even in his condition, he might hit him!&rdquo;
urged Bill, trying to disengage his arm from
Tom&rsquo;s restraining clutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a magician,&rdquo; Tom replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
interfere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill stared at his young companion in amazement;
then his eyes turned to observe the expected
result. Henry, the rifle leveled, stood
on his uncertain feet, trying to &ldquo;draw a bead&rdquo;
with the wavering sights.</p>
<p>Toosa, arms folded, did not move. His eyes
were fixed on Henry.</p>
<p>In the brush, Indians were watching intently.
Would their magician and healer, their guide
and guardian, falter? Could the white man with
the devil-stick that spat fire and death&mdash;could
he&mdash;&mdash;?</p>
<p>Suddenly Henry advanced a step, lowering
his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&mdash;give you&mdash;chance!&rdquo; he sputtered.
&ldquo;I give&mdash;you chance! &lsquo;C-&rsquo;cause why? &lsquo;C-&rsquo;cause
you got to tell me where is Mort Beecher an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;the
Golden Sun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toosa did not move, nor did he open his
lips. He simply stood, eyes coldly, glowingly
fixed on the furious, maudlin white man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;You tell, I not shoot&mdash;I call men and put
you out of way till we finish,&rdquo; Henry called in
his husky voice. &ldquo;Then we fix the two who
come with me&mdash;eh, boys?&rdquo; He swung, staggering
a little, to try and get response from the
brush. Not an Indian showed himself or moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Toosa run&mdash;Toosa! Toosa&mdash;run
while he&rsquo;s not watching!&rdquo; shrilled Bill
breaking from the hut.</p>
<p>Toosa made one gesture, a slight gesture.
Bill saw it and stopped, while Tom advanced to
Bill&rsquo;s side, though both retired into the hut&rsquo;s
shadow as Henry, with a muttered word that
was not good to hear, swung on his heel, caught
his balance and glowered toward the hut. Then
he pulled the trigger; there was a flash, but
while Bill flung Tom back into the hut, neither
was struck, nor did they hear where the bullet
went.</p>
<p>Henry instantly swung back to face Toosa
who had not moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Tell me. Where is
Mort Beecher! Where is that Golden Sun mine
he told me about! You know! You can tell!
Tell now, if you want&mdash;want see sun&mdash;sun rise
in morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toosa, arms folded, waited, wordless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo; Henry growled, his voice
shaking. He took another huge gulp from a
calabash of liquid fire, choked, gasped and then
re-sighted his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>Tom held tightly to Bill&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>There came the flash and roar of the rifle.</p>
<p>Toosa did not move!</p>
<p>Again and again, until its magazine was
spent. Henry fired.</p>
<p>Toosa brushed some fiery sparks from the
old coat he wore, and laughed, a horrible sound
of triumph and rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White man not hurt Toosa!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Choking and sputtering in his fury Henry
raised and reversed his rifle, clubbed it and
rushed.</p>
<p>At the same instant Tom, like a streak of
lightning, raced across the space; but he arrived
too late; Toosa, with his long arms,
caught the rifle and with a wrench tore it from
Henry&rsquo;s grip. He flung it aside but Henry, lost
to all sense of decency or judgment, flung his
weight against Toosa.</p>
<p>Toosa, braced as he was, gave back a step
under the impact. Bill was almost beside Tom
as the latter drew back, unable to interfere as
Toosa&rsquo;s foot caught on a projecting root at the
side of the level space; down he went with a
thud, and instantly Henry, on top, reached for
his throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Toosa fought like a tiger, his own ape-like
arms giving him the advantage of reach in the
grapple for throatholds. But the fall had
stunned Toosa a little and he did not grip with
his customary strength.</p>
<p>Tom, with a quick insight, saw that Henry
had an advantage.</p>
<p>Whether it was right or wrong to take part
against a white man and to fight for an Indian
would not at any time have bothered Tom. He
knew that color did not matter; that it was the
spirit and quality of a man that counted and
not the skin he wore. So, unhesitatingly, he
caught Henry&rsquo;s legs and flung them, with all
his strength, toward the side, thus unbalancing
Henry, and causing him to roll, and to fling out
an arm, instinctively, to catch himself.</p>
<p>In that instant Toosa recovered his power,
scrambled up and stood watching Henry, sputtering
and clamping his teeth in his rage.
Toosa gave a sharp call. The Indians, no longer
wondering if their leader was supreme, rushed
forward and quickly secured Henry. He was
bound and taken to another hut. Toosa turned
to Tom, and with about the only smile Tom ever
saw on his face, Toosa spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You save life!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;You good. I
help!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;You great
magic man, I only help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Toosa answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we sleep,&rdquo; he said. Not one of the
Indians went near the rude trough again. They
trooped away, all except two he appointed to
guard Henry in his small hut. Toosa picked
up the rifle and walked off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He surely is a great magician,&rdquo; Bill commented,
as he and Tom lay on their rudely made
bedding of woven vines and soft branches.
&ldquo;Henry, bad as he was, couldn&rsquo;t have missed
him with all those shells!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, nestling into a comfortable
spot, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to take any credit away
from Toosa&rsquo;s magic&mdash;but I helped it along a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; demanded Bill, lifting to one elbow
and staring into the blackness of the hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he might get boisterous&mdash;that
Henry!&rdquo; &lsquo;Tom answered. &ldquo;So I took the chance,
while you and he dozed in the hut after supper,
and dug the bullets out of his magazine full of
cartridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Bill, soberly, &ldquo;I never thought
of that. You&rsquo;re a pardner. Shake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">HENRY TURNS SAVAGE</span></h2>
<p>Late that night a tropical storm whirled
down on the village from the mountains. Lightning
that seemed more vivid than daylight
flashed continuously; thunder that deafened
shook and roared; trees thudded to the whipping
lash of the lightning. Rain in literal sheets
made a wall of water when Tom peered out
from the door of their hut.</p>
<p>When the dull dawn came the rain had not
subsided; thunder still growled and boomed.
The river, rising swiftly, was a very torrent,
its water racing toward the rapids below, whose
roar could be heard like a growling undertone
to the thrum of falling water.</p>
<p>A white rubber-trader, with his canoe full of
paddlers, was glad to be able to nose in and
ground his craft on the sandy beach and drag
it to safety before the river rose any more
dangerously.</p>
<p>Toosa knew him and took him at once to his
own hut for a talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Henry was released from guard, but did not
come near his companions; in fact, he stayed
close to his hut, more safely guarded from
violent action by the downpour than by any
watchers.</p>
<p>About noon the rain slackened and the white
trader, Buckley, a quiet and yet a pleasant man,
bronzed and sturdy, came over and visited with
the white pair. Tom found him eager to hear
about the situation that had come about on the
previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have extracted those bullets,
Toosa has told me,&rdquo; he said with a smile.
&ldquo;Toosa is sure that he could have turned the
bullets aside. He is very sure of his magic
powers. But I like the old fellow and I am
rather glad our young friend had so much foresight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>He told them that, even without the rain,
it would be unlikely that they could start down
the river for some time. Yellow fever, that
terror of the tropics, had broken out near the
coast, and inland, and a &ldquo;deadline&rdquo; had been
established near the costal villages by the
Honduran government. That deadline was a
real thing, not merely a place where officers
stopped people and examined their health. When
fever broke out, the trader explained, a line
was drawn across the roads, and a patrol established
on the rivers. If anyone passed through
an infected area they would be turned back at
the line, and if they tried to pass bullets would
follow the act. The government meant its
quarantine! And to get to the cruiser they
must pass through the infected area!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came here to learn about a man,&rdquo; the
trader told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we did,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;Do you
know anything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He eagerly related the conditions of his
sister&rsquo;s disappearance. The white man listened
gravely and then shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toosa will be here in a few minutes,&rdquo; he
stated. &ldquo;He has asked me some curiously veiled
questions. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if what I
answered has something to do with the results
he will get from his &lsquo;magic&rsquo;&mdash;but he is a fine
old magician, and it helps his standing among
the natives to let him keep them deceived&mdash;so
I will let him reveal what his &lsquo;magic calabash&rsquo;
whispers to him.&rdquo; He laughed as Toosa, grave
and stately in spite of his deformed body, came
in. Several other Indians were with him and
quite a crowd assembled outside. These he dispersed,
telling them something in their dialect
which Bill guessed was to the effect that his
magic was, this time, for the white ears alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Those who accompanied him hung heavy
skins over the door, and took up positions outside,
shooing away the straggling women who
thirsted for every demonstration of their
chief&rsquo;s magical powers.</p>
<p>Toosa set on the trampled earth floor a calabash,
and some other articles of his supposed
craft; then he produced a skin bottle or flask
and from it poured into the calabash a dark,
rather evil smelling liquid, till the gourd container
was level full.</p>
<p>Tom, watching closely, thought he detected a
tiny wink pass between the solemn old fraud
and his trade friend; however, Tom kept his
own counsel and refrained from trying to catch
Bill&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>If they got the information he sought, it did
not matter to him if Toosa liked to impart a
touch of mystery to the telling!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You good,&rdquo; Toosa said to Tom. &ldquo;I help.
Tell what you not know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He built up a small fire of tiny twigs and let
it burn until the sticks fell together, flared and
then died down to a small flicker.</p>
<p>Onto that he threw some leaves and bits of
dust or herbs finely powdered, and instantly
a dense, whitish, and very pungent smoke rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now how do you suppose an Indian in
Central America knows a trick that the African
blacks use in their magic?&rdquo; Tom said, out of
the corner of his mouth, to Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;They tell us in books that people came here
from some old continent, ages ago&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it
Atlantic&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atlantis!&rdquo; corrected Tom. &ldquo;Cliff&rsquo;s father
told us about it&mdash;it was a great continent and
it sank under the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, before it went down, history says,
some wise people knew it was going to happen,
and they came away and settled in safer
places,&rdquo; Bill stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Toosa is one of their
descendants?&rdquo; Tom whispered. &ldquo;He surely does
seem to know a lot. And maybe some of the
Atlantis people went to Africa, and that&rsquo;s how
the same customs spread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; agreed Bill. &ldquo;Look, he&rsquo;s swallowing
the smoke. Don&rsquo;t see how he stands it&mdash;just
a sniff makes me sort of chokey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toosa was drawing in great, sighing lungsful
of the heavy and pungently acrid smoke. Then
he settled back on his haunches, and to the
amazement of even the trader, he spoke&mdash;in
English!<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;want&mdash;find&mdash;out&mdash;man called Mort
Beech,&rdquo; Toosa chanted in a halting, but deep,
voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom with a little shiver of inherited
superstition, even though he knew there
was more fuss than truth in the witchcraft part,
even though the English was amazing. &ldquo;Yes,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man is Colon&mdash;or Porto Bell&rsquo;&mdash;look for in
Porto Bell&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Porto Bello, eh?&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Porto Bell&rsquo;. Yes. Now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a commotion at the doorway.
Henry Morgan had crept up to see what was
so mysteriously transpiring in the hut, and as
the two guards had no instructions concerning
him and did not dare to interrupt their chief,
Henry had listened, had caught the whole message.</p>
<p>While Bill leaped up and Tom caught his
feet under him swiftly, Henry strode into the
hut, kicking over the calabash, into which Toosa
had been staring after he inhaled the smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Porto Bello!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
where Henry Morgan will find him. As for
you&mdash;&rdquo; he swung on his white companions, &ldquo;you
can follow me if you dare&mdash;but if you do, I
shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snatched up Bill&rsquo;s rifle, just before Tom
anticipated his move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;I take this,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause why? Toosa
has mine. Now I go in canoe. I&rsquo;ll tell your
friends the yellow-jack got you. They can&rsquo;t
pass the deadlines to find out. We&rsquo;ll take the
cruiser and go on. When we find Mort Beecher
I&rsquo;ll let them come back and hunt you up if they
want to. I&rsquo;ll have what I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swine!&rdquo; cried Bill, halted by the rifle
in the menacing hands. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how you repay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I repay that kid for what he
did to my&mdash;stuff!&rdquo; growled Henry. Toosa made
an effort to stop him as he backed toward the
door, but the smoke had really taken some of
Toosa&rsquo;s strength, or at least he was not swift
enough in his move, for Henry sidestepped and
sent a cruel kick at the dark face. Toosa fell
back in time to avoid it, but Henry, thrusting
the peering Indians to each side, backed out
and turned as Bill tugged at a revolver.</p>
<p>Still striving to loosen the weapon, which his
excitement made more of a task than it should
have been, he raced to the door, Tom at his
heels. They saw Henry Morgan running, rifle
under his arm, for the sandy beach, where a
rushing torrent worried at the sand and bore
it away in great, swirling streaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s after a canoe,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>Bill raised a pistol. Toosa, with a quick grip,
thrust back Bill&rsquo;s arm, shaking his head violently
and choking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Running a light canoe out partly into the
turbulent stream, Henry reached into the
beached canoe of the trader, holding their menacing
approach back by a threat with the rifle,
and threw some of the trader&rsquo;s goods into the
small canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the pistol if you&rsquo;re afraid to fire!&rdquo;
cried Buckley, the trader; but again Toosa held
his arm.</p>
<p>They watched the canoe skip away from the
bank and whirl, end for end, in an eddy. Then
Henry got his paddle to working and with a
derisive shout, swung his blade and straightened
away, flying down the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t you let us stop him?&rdquo; Tom
cried, angry at Toosa. He saw their companions
being urged to desert by a false story,
saw themselves stranded in the Indian country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toosa says, &lsquo;Rapids get him,&rsquo;&rdquo; Buckley
translated, for Toosa now spoke curtly in his
own dialect, making swift gestures. &ldquo;Toosa
says if the rapids don&rsquo;t drag him under, as is
likely, the deadline will stop him. He&rsquo;ll never
get through. As for you fellows&mdash;if you can
put up with privations and hard climbing, I
can arrange with some of my Indians to escort
you over the mountains&mdash;to the capital, and
from there you can easily get down to the coast
and your cruiser and your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if Henry should get through!&rdquo; Tom objected.
&ldquo;We ought to try and catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the trader remonstrated. &ldquo;Wait! He
will either get out of control&mdash;he&rsquo;s weakened
from his heavy debauches&mdash;and go over the
falls instead of down the side currents and
rapids, or he will be caught by the Indians and
the Honduran soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad it had to happen right in the
middle of the witchcraft,&rdquo; mused Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the trader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toosa failed to tell us about the Golden
Sun,&rdquo; Tom said, knowing what was in his comrade&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Buckley spoke swiftly to Toosa who responded
with a shake of his head. Then he became
very thoughtful. Suddenly he walked away
into the hut and sat, staring into the calabash,
with its remaining liquid, the rest having been
spilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any Golden Sun mine, at all,&rdquo;
Mr. Buckley explained. &ldquo;The gold in the Honduran
mountains in this section would be commercially
profitless if you tried to mine it and
get it to the coast. Those days of prosperity
for Honduras are far in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Henry told us that Mort Beecher kept
talking about the Golden Sun,&rdquo; Tom remonstrated.
&ldquo;There must be something behind it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>With a long arm Toosa beckoned to them.
They hurried into the hut and stood, respectful
and curious. Toosa looked up. This is what
Buckley repeated from his curious sing-song
chant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a Golden Sun! The Golden Sun
is not a mine! The Golden Sun is alive. Ask
of the San Blas Indians&mdash;and say that Toosa
of the Mosquito country sent you. You find!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find what?&rdquo; asked Tom; but Toosa was out
of the hut&mdash;and gone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">A FALSE MESSAGE</span></h2>
<p>With her propeller hammered out by slow,
careful work, and with new gears in her speed
changing device, the <i>Porto Bello</i> was once more
ready for the sea.</p>
<p>Then there were long days of waiting.</p>
<p>Nicky was all set to start up the Rio Patuca.
But Cliff agreed with his father and with Joe
Anderson, &ldquo;Andy,&rdquo; that it was unwise. Although
the large village of the Mosquito Indians
just a short way up the lagoon was not
yet infected, villages beyond it were suffering
from yellow fever epidemics and the older heads
judged that the boat could not pass the inevitable
quarantine.</p>
<p>Cliff and Nicky were greatly worried about
Tom; but they could do nothing but wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t get up to him, he can&rsquo;t get down
to us,&rdquo; Nicky affirmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Cliff. &ldquo;This is going to be a
slow time. We can&rsquo;t get any news, either. But
the Indian we saw yesterday says that he thinks
the fever is not as far up the river as Tom
went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Nicky agreed.</p>
<p>They passed the tedious days fighting the
wickedly biting sand flies. The evenings sent
the flies away, and there were long, beautiful
and peaceful hours after sunset, before the mosquitos
came out as far as the cruiser, when they
could sit on deck and watch the stars; the glowing,
sparkling orbs seemed very close, very
clear and most beautiful. But there were many
evenings when dull skies hovered above, when
there was nothing to do but read the few books
they had, or sit and talk. Mr. Gray told them
countless stories of the old civilizations, and
about the Indian customs and legends.</p>
<p>But all through the dreary wait they worried
about Tom.</p>
<p>Then, one night, Henry arrived!</p>
<p>His body was thin and starved looking, and
his clothes were rags. He came in a canoe and
there was great excitement when he was recognized.
Questions volleyed at him from all sides,
but he would not talk&mdash;in fact, he could hardly
stand&mdash;until he had been given some stewed
turtle, a sweet yam and some fruit and tea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>He had not eaten such food for days, he told
the eager party. To their questions about Tom
he made one statement, and of course the chums
had no way of guessing that it was false.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom and Bill,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;they got took
with fever. Not bad, but some. Bill found a
good Indian doctor and he&rsquo;s pulling them
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told of his experiences in running the
rapids and it was very probable that his story
was not over-false as he recounted the thrills
and dangers of his fight with the surging waters
and the perilous rocks.</p>
<p>He had managed to get through by good fortune,
he declared. Then he had gone on down
the river until he came near the quarantine,
and had deserted his canoe and gone into the
brush. He happened to know of an inland village
and he had made his way to that.</p>
<p>There he had found a guide who, on the promise
of all the money he had, took him through
the jungle, around the quarantined post. From
there he had followed the river again, borrowing
a canoe and avoiding every human habitation
because he was in the fever zone. Once
more, at the lower point of the infected area,
he had taken to the brush, and with many privations,
eating what he could find in the woods,
or what game he could shoot, he had finally
won out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>He made the tale a strong appeal for sympathy
and fed his own vanity on the admiration
of the chums.</p>
<p>All unsuspecting of his villainous desertion,
he was made a sort of hero. Only Nicky seemed
to be quiet and thoughtful. Finally he interrupted
the second recital, late in the evening.
Henry recalled some additional details of his
misery, and repeated the whole story to get
them in their proper places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you stay with Tom and Bill?&rdquo;
Nicky said finally. It seemed strange to him
that Henry should have deserted his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left them on purpose,&rdquo; Henry said.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause they sent me. They told
me to come. They wanted me to. &rsquo;Cause why?
They sent you a message!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you told it?&rdquo; cried Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was plenty of time,&rdquo; responded
Henry, his old manner somewhat restored by
good food and some rest. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t leave
where they are till the fever quits them. We
can&rsquo;t go up and do them any good. So they
sent a message&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Nicky demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is it! You go on. I found out, from
Toosa, that the fellow we want is at Porto
Bello&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Porto Bello?&rdquo; echoed Cliff. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
name of this boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the name of a town, too&mdash;a place where
the old pirate, Henry Morgan, once had his
rendezvous,&rdquo; Nicky explained. His study of the
old histories of pirate life gave him that information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he in Porto Bello for?&rdquo; asked Cliff.</p>
<p>Henry shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all he could tell. Go to Porto Bello
was what he ordered. Then Tom and Bill said
for us to go on and find this fellow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name&mdash;you never told us,&rdquo; Nicky
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name&mdash;oh, never mind. I&rsquo;ll be along.
I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why must we go on without knowing
how Tom and Bill are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; spoke up &ldquo;Andy,&rdquo; &ldquo;if they&rsquo;re sick
they can&rsquo;t travel, and we couldn&rsquo;t get this boat
to them even if we could get past the deadlines.
And, instead of waiting here, doing nothing,
we could go and find that lad and learn
what he can tell us and then come back here.
By that time the worst of the fever scare may
be over and we can get our comrades and save
time by going right where we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gray seemed to agree, although he hesitated
and asked Henry many questions.</p>
<p>Nicky, however, was very quiet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; he told Cliff, as the two
were sitting, far beyond midnight&mdash;they were
too excited to sleep&mdash;watching the cold moonlight
throw mosquitos into tiny, black silhouettes
on the netting of the protecting cover
under which they stayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it myself,&rdquo; Cliff replied. &ldquo;But
what can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to go to the capital, and
send help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Cliff objected, &ldquo;if Tom and Bill are
in the fever zone, the Honduras authorities
won&rsquo;t let them come out or let us go to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go off and leave them, only
knowing what Henry says about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff shook his head and answered soberly,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to! But I can&rsquo;t see what we could
do in the capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Henry has told us the truth?&rdquo;
Nicky demanded, under his breath.</p>
<p>Cliff considered the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;What makes
you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is he so anxious for us to go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save time, as Andy argued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe to save something else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Cliff whispered, shuddering, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand. Save what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His neck, maybe. Suppose he found out
where the man is&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>He did not finish his sentence, but Cliff shivered
and grew very thoughtful. Finally he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust him much. I wish we knew&mdash;the
facts!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE FACTS</span></h2>
<p>Those Indians picked by the white trader,
Mr. Buckley, to take Tom and Cliff across the
mountain ways toward the capital, were by no
means pleasant companions. Even in looks they
were disconcerting.</p>
<p>Their faces were cruel and hard; their bodies
were stalwart and powerful; they spoke very
little, and then in their own peculiar up-river
and mountain dialects. Toosa warned Bill
quietly that they were noted for their avarice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give no money,&rdquo; Toosa warned. &ldquo;Hide. Not
show. They&mdash;&rdquo; He made a meaning gesture,
drawing his hand across his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very pleasant companions, buddy,&rdquo; Bill
told Tom, as they got into the canoe which
would take them further up the river. &ldquo;But
Toosa says if we don&rsquo;t show fear or weakness
we will be all right&mdash;only, keep what money you
have in your belt close to your skin and never
let on that you have any!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s last act before leaving Toosa, completely
won the old man&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>He called the great-grandson, Porfirio, to his
forward seat in the canoe, and gave him, for
his very own, the magnet with which the boy
so often played. Toosa&rsquo;s eyes lighted up when
he saw the boy&rsquo;s dazed, almost awed look;
Toosa smiled&mdash;a real smile.</p>
<p>Suddenly coming close to the leader of the
mountain Indians, three in number, he made
some very firm declarations&mdash;to the effect that
the white men were in his keeping and that he
would watch over them and know if anything
happened to them&mdash;and on the least sign of
such danger he would release all the spirits of
the mountain&mdash;evil ones!&mdash;to punish the offending
Indians. They seemed to be strongly impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll be safe enough now,&rdquo; Bill said.
&ldquo;That magnet is going to be a life-saver, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cheap price to pay for insurance,&rdquo;
Tom grinned, and they were sent out into the
current by the lusty paddles of the four river
natives who owned the canoe and who would
take them on the first lap of their roundabout
trip to the coast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Their last sight of Toosa was one Tom would
never forget; he had an arm around the shoulders
of the child; behind his dwarfed figure
clustered the Indian men, women and children.
He lifted his long arm high in air, and made
a sort of sign with his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Gravy!&rdquo; whispered Tom, to Bill. &ldquo;Did
you see that? How in the world did he come
to make that sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sign? With his fingers? Why, I suppose
it&rsquo;s a benediction or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spread all his fingers wide; then he
closed them tight, then spread them wide
again,&rdquo; gasped Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; demanded Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Tom, in some awe, &ldquo;that is the
sign of our Mystery Boys&rsquo; order, as you very
well know&mdash;the sign of &lsquo;Goodbye, good luck and
God be with you,&rsquo; that we use at parting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By golly!&rdquo; said Bill, and stayed silent a
long time. What a coincidence that the almost
savage man who lived in the woods had made
such a final message without knowing, perhaps,
that he did so&mdash;unless the boys had stumbled
upon some ancient sign of some old cult.</p>
<p>After several days on the river the canoe was
beached and the trio of mountaineers bade a
gruff farewell to their river brethren, and, with
heavy packs, of which Tom and Bill had their
full share, the five started on foot for one of
the most difficult and trying tramps Tom had
ever experienced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Before nightfall a small village was reached,
and there the party was to stay over night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I understand, it&rsquo;s proper in these
parts to give our firearms to our host as a
mark of good faith, for over night,&rdquo; Bill told
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be safe enough, if it&rsquo;s a custom,&rdquo;
Tom said, glancing at the ring of rough, coarse,
dark faces studying them curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s supposed to hand them right back,
Toosa said,&rdquo; Bill answered, and accordingly he
gave his rifle and one pistol to the Indian in
whose hut they were quartered, while Tom
handed over the other, given him by Bill. But
the host did not hand them back.</p>
<p>No harm came to them during the night, however,
although Bill was uneasy without his
weapons.</p>
<p>Day after day, from then on, they went forward
by increasingly difficult stages, first following
the river, winding upward among the
lower mountains, past dangerous rapids, over
steep knolls, through rough canyons and up almost
precipitous inclines, where ropes had to
be used to hold any one who slipped from plunging
to destruction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Hard as was the way, and tiresome as was
the furious pace set by the hardened mountain
Indians, Bill and Tom kept up well, for Tom
was of an athletic frame and always kept his
body in perfect trim by lots of exercise, sports
and fresh air, while Bill was of the lean, rangy
type and never seemed to tire.</p>
<p>The attitude of their companions was a continual
worry to Bill, however. Tom felt it also.
Often he caught one or another of the three
fierce-looking men watching him covertly in the
camps, with speculative eyes roaming over his
weapon, his clothing, his pack.</p>
<p>The Indians said little, but in their manner
there seemed to be some expectancy, as if they
either felt or knew that something was going
to happen.</p>
<p>As the way grew more steep and difficult,
the men seemed to be watching even more carefully,
and Tom asked Bill what it meant. Bill,
who understood their degraded Spanish words,
used occasionally, but who pretended not to,
replied that they were making some plan but he
could not guess what it was.</p>
<p>They had reached a deep ravine, away high
among the crags, and could look from it across
a wide chasm, when a sudden storm caused them
to make a hasty camp under a sheltering overhang
of rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The men drew off and huddled together while
Tom and Bill stuck close together under the
rubber poncho which Bill carried. Presently one
of the men approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You give coat, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill hesitated, but Tom, with a sudden inspiration,
threw aside the covering with a generous
wave of his hand. The man seemed surprised
but took the garment away and the trio
of Indians used it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll demand everything
we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;but we can stave them
off at least until we get out of this ticklish place.
If we get them mad, away up here, they could
push us off the side, before we could wake up
from sleep. We ought to keep them quiet till
we get to a better place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they want to rob us and desert us?&rdquo;
Bill hazarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Tom agreed. &ldquo;But as long as we
keep our pistols and your rifle, it will be all
safe; we can take turns watching at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did, and Tom, on watch that night, noticed
a creeping figure, coming close to their
soggy mosquito protection, but made no sign.
He told Bill, when the later awoke, and they redoubled
their watchfulness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The next day they went on and came into a
high, and rough, but fairly level plateau where
they camped. Bill managed to shoot a wild pig
and it was roasted for dinner. With some biscuit
made of flour, salt and water, and with
cocoa, they made a regular feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men are planning something,&rdquo; Tom
whispered, after the meal. &ldquo;See how they look
at one another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s just be ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon enough they had to be. The leader came
over to them and in a very polite way, for him,
made a suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We afraid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bad mountain cat
close by.&rdquo; They had heard the cry of a jaguar
or panther, or some other huge cat. &ldquo;You have
guns, you save. We not got. We be died!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of us sits up and watches all night,&rdquo;
declared Bill, meaningly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. We
not let you be hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man walked away doubtfully, and that
night neither Tom nor Bill took much rest;
however, nothing more happened.</p>
<p>The next morning they were surprised to discover
that the Indians seemed very much more
pleasant, and the leader brought the whites a
special and tasteful piece of the roast pig which
he had saved for them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to
treat them,&rdquo; Bill said. &ldquo;Let them know we are
on guard!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>They went on, and were wading along in a
small torrent of water, the only way through
a deep abyss, when suddenly Tom clutched
Bill&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;I feel queer and sick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I?&rdquo; replied Bill. &ldquo;But I tried not to
let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what?&rdquo; gasped Tom, as a
great, sweeping spasm of pain flooded over him
and he saw, as through a haze, Bill&rsquo;s face whitening,
even as Bill staggered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; gulped Bill, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indian poisons are subtle, but they work
swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially a toadstool called &lsquo;Fruit of the
earth&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">TOOSA&rsquo;S VENGEANCE</span></h2>
<p>Cliff and Nicky faced Henry Morgan on the
cruiser&rsquo;s deck. &ldquo;Well, you are a fine one,&rdquo; Cliff
sneered. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare say what you do
if my father and Andy hadn&rsquo;t gone to the
Indian village to find out if the fever quarantine
is lifted up the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would,&rdquo; Henry said huskily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
say it just the same. &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s
true. I mean it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You actually mean you&rsquo;re going to ship on
that sloop, lying off the reef?&rdquo; Nicky argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship on that schooner and leave you&mdash;yes!
&rsquo;Cause why? What have you done about finding
Mort Beecher, or&mdash;or the Golden Sun? Not
one thing! You all sit around&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to scrape the hull and straighten
the propeller and fix the shaft while you were
gone&mdash;&rdquo; Cliff grew angry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but when I got there, all was fixed and
the cruiser was back in commission. But she&rsquo;s
laid still in the tide-race, here, for three days,
and no move to go to Porto Bello, the way the
old Indian said I should. I told you what word
was sent from your friends&mdash;but you just sit
and fight sand-flies and mosquitos and sweat
and chafe and eat bananas and fire cocoanuts
at sharks&rsquo; fins. I&rsquo;m tired of waitin&rsquo;. So, when
that cutter comes off from final trading
with the Indians, it&rsquo;s Henry Morgan for on
board and off for Colon or wherever the sloop
touches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff and Nicky looked at one another dubiously.
This was a predicament. Cliff&rsquo;s father
had gone ashore to pay the Indians in fancy
articles for helping to beach the cruiser first
and then to drive her back into the water. Cliff
had caught Henry packing a &ldquo;ditty bag&rdquo; and
the resulting declaration that he was &ldquo;quitting
them,&rdquo; brought Nicky racing to Cliff&rsquo;s hail. But
they were puzzled to know how to summon the
older men from the village.</p>
<p>Finally, with a shrug, touching his left ear
gently, to indicate to his chum that he wanted
the Mystery Boys&rsquo; signals to be noted and understood,
Cliff pushed his hair over his right
ear with an index finger, indicating to Nicky,
&ldquo;Come with me!&rdquo; Nicky promptly swung on
his heel, with a contemptuous glance at Henry,
and went below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t tie him, or anything!&rdquo; Nicky objected
when Cliff asked what they could do.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see what good it will do to stop him.
We know all he knows&mdash;that Mort Beecher is at
Porto Bello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Cliff agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let him go.
I guess we can get along just as well without
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better,&rdquo; Nicky declared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took no action, therefore, when Henry
climbed aboard the ship&rsquo;s shore-boat and went
out, across the sand bars, across the reefs, and,
one would suppose, out of their lives.</p>
<p>However, the afternoon was well along before
they stopped talking about him, about Tom
and Bill, and about everything that had happened.
By that time Mr. Gray and Andy had
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we care if that Morgan is gone?&rdquo;
demanded Joe Anderson. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a poor comrade
on a cruise. First he almost let us be
broken up on the reefs because he liked &lsquo;tonic&rsquo;
better than watching; then he deserted our companions,
and for all we know, did worse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can start up the river, anyhow,&rdquo; Mr.
Gray stated. &ldquo;The river towns are no longer
quarantined against the lower coast or the upper
river. We can run as far up river as the
boat will navigate and then several of us can
go to Tom and Billy Sanders by canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly the anchor was raised the next
morning and with a river Indian aboard as
pilot, they ran smoothly and quickly up the
lagoon. When they were about a day&rsquo;s run up
the Rio Patuca, Nicky, at the bow, watching the
alligators slide off of the sand banks, seeing the
strange, bright birds flying over the water, suddenly
gave a cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that white people in that canoe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; echoed Cliff, running to his side.
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; shrilled Nicky, dancing about until
the pilot, watching the shifting currents, had to
catch his coat and prevent him from toppling
off the sharp bow.</p>
<p>Tom it was, with Bill, both alive, and quite
hearty.</p>
<p>The story of their exploits was a thrilling
one. They had been in the first throes of suffering
from a violent poison administered in, or
with their food by the Indians conducting them
through the mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom recalled that I had a bottle of white
vaseline in my pack,&rdquo; Bill said, &ldquo;and he crawled
to it and got the stuff. It was not very easy
to take, but we each got some down, and it
melted and made a sort of oily coating, or else
it acted as an emetic, for we were very sick,
and almost wore ourselves out struggling&mdash;and
we couldn&rsquo;t get enough water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was lucky for us that we were right by
the stream, almost in it,&rdquo; Tom added. &ldquo;The
Indians didn&rsquo;t move a hand to help. If we
hadn&rsquo;t kept sense enough to hold onto our pistols
I guess they would have jumped on us.
We found out later that they had picked some
sort of mushroom&mdash;&lsquo;fruit of the earth&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
called, in the lower levels, and put some in folds
of the pork meat when they gave it to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find that out?&rdquo; Nicky demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they confess?&rdquo; asked Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toosa told us,&rdquo; Tom explained. &ldquo;He claims
that he knew by his magic spells that we were
in danger, and that he came to save us; and
for that he expected Bill to give him Henry&rsquo;s
rifle when we left&mdash;which Bill was glad to do.
But he and I privately think it was more chance
than planning that brought him just in time to
help us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you have lived as long as I,&rdquo; said
Mr. Gray quietly, &ldquo;you will understand that
there isn&rsquo;t any such thing as &lsquo;luck&rsquo; or &lsquo;chance&rsquo;
or &lsquo;coincidence.&rsquo; It is all a part of a Great
Purpose, that is deeper than most of us can
see; but it is there, and we do not have to depend
on &lsquo;chance&rsquo; to get out of difficulties. If
we believed in ourselves, and do our honest best
for ourselves, help will come as we need it.
Toosa, perhaps, was worried about you and so
his intuition was keen and he felt that he should
follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you are right,&rdquo; Tom admitted. &ldquo;Anyway,
Toosa got there in time to stop the Indians
from running away, after they divided
our packs and while they were hoping we would
die so they could get our gun and pistols and
cartridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Toosa do?&rdquo; asked Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He threatened he would revenge himself if
they hurt you, Bill has told us,&rdquo; Nicky added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had his vengeance, but in a curious way,&rdquo;
Tom said, glancing at Bill, as if for his backing-up
of the story. Bill nodded encouragement and
Tom continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toosa called the Indians back and they
came, slinking and cowering, like whipped dogs.
I don&rsquo;t know yet what there was about him that
scared them so, but he certainly ruled them by
fear. He called them to him and then he made
them stand there while he looked them steadily
in the eye. Bill, the Indian he had with him
was close to you, what did he tell you Toosa
said in their own language?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Toosa said, &lsquo;Which you like best, to eat rest
of &ldquo;fruit of earth&rdquo; with roast wild pig, or have
mountain spirits follow you and drive you into
chasm?&rsquo;&rdquo; Bill related it with a reminiscent
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They picked the wild pig and the poison
mushrooms,&rdquo; Nicky guessed. &ldquo;I know that much
about these Central American Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We urged Toosa to be easy on them,&rdquo; Tom
said. &ldquo;But he said it must be a lesson, and he
made them go through with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t let us wait to see,&rdquo; Bill replied.
&ldquo;He winked at me and told me to leave what
there was in the vaseline bottle, and let them
see how their own medicine man can save them
with &lsquo;white man&rsquo;s butter.&rsquo; They weren&rsquo;t even
sick when we started back. The river was free
of quarantine and so, of course, after we got
back to it, we had no trouble at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget Toosa, waving to me with
the very sign of the Mystery Boys, again, as
we canoed away down stream,&rdquo; Tom added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad your adventure ended so pleasantly&mdash;for
you,&rdquo; Mr. Gray stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it wasn&rsquo;t too unpleasant for the hill
Indians,&rdquo; Andy said. &ldquo;But if they were as sick
as you that would be justice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;And in the long run, if you wait long
enough,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Justice is always done, one
way or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Henry Morgan still has some punishment
due him,&rdquo; said Nicky and the desertion
and falsehood of the departed pilot was discussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sent no message,&rdquo; said Bill, telling how
Henry had turned savage and stolen his rifle
and a canoe. &ldquo;Wait till I catch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he was going to Porto Bello,&rdquo; said
Nicky. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;At least, only for a brief
stop to see if Mort is there and if he really
knows anything. Toosa told us, after Henry
made his mad dash, that if we want to find out
about Golden Sun&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t a mine, either, he
says!&mdash;we are to ask the San Blas Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They live on reef islands down below Panama,
I think,&rdquo; Bill said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; finished Tom, &ldquo;if the Golden Sun isn&rsquo;t
a mine&mdash;my sister had golden hair&mdash;do you suppose?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
No one answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">THE PORTO BELLO PUZZLE</span></h2>
<p>Out from the Mosquito country the cruiser
fought her way again; her machinery did not
fail, and information given by the Indians,
coupled with a fairly quiet sea, enabled the adventurers
to make a safe passage through the
treacherous rocks and the surging rollers.</p>
<p>There was no excitement during the run down
the coast. Into the well-traveled route to and
from the Panama Canal the voyagers worked
the boat, and, by agreement, a stop was made
at Colon.</p>
<p>In an earlier adventure the three chums,
Tom, Cliff and Nicky, had visited Panama, and
the great achievement of the Canal was therefore
not a novelty to them, although they never
ceased to marvel at the engineering skill by
which it had been planned and built, nor did
the vastness of its locks, the precision of its
machinery, ever fail to make them thrill as
they thought&mdash;the United States&mdash;&ldquo;our country&rdquo;&mdash;accomplished
that feat. To them it was
the Spirit of American success in an undertaking
that made the world better and communication
easier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>They did not wait long in Colon; only until
Bill and Mr. Gray made inquiries about Mort
Beecher.</p>
<p>As they traced the story, they learned,
through many contacts which Mr. Gray&rsquo;s reputation
as a great scholar opened to them, that
Morton Beecher had come to Colon, a few years
before, and had seemed to be a very rich person.
He had spent money freely and had gotten
into a group of Spanish and of American
pleasure-seekers who spent lavishly on the
more sordid delights of a tropical life. Not
many months ago Mort, broken in health and
with no more money, had been compelled, as
far as was known, to seek his fortune elsewhere.
No one would give him employment because he
was not dependable, had no strength, and spent
all of his time bemoaning the vanished past of
his opulence. No one knew just what had happened
to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>However, through the story that Henry Morgan
had told them, they guessed that Mort&rsquo;s
misfortunes had finally led him to Porto Bello,
that decayed spot on the Panama coast of the
Caribbean which had once been a stronghold
of the notorious pirate, Henry Morgan the first,
the man who had first raided the Central and
South American shipping and the towns of the
coast, robbing and pillaging, and then had become
reformed to such an extent that he had
ended by making war on piracy and had
achieved the great fame of being the governor
of Jamaica who had done more than any other
to &ldquo;clean out&rdquo; that nest of piratical looters.</p>
<p>With the wind kicking up a rough sea, the
cruiser, namesake of the place they were bound
for, headed toward Porto Bello.</p>
<p>With a pilot, a negro who called himself Bob,
taking the place in their party vacated by
Henry&rsquo;s defection, they made the run safely,
if under rough conditions. The entrance into
the harbor of the ancient Spanish port was attended
with only the usual dangers of any of
the reef-locked, rock-studded passages along the
coast.</p>
<p>Tom, Nicky and Cliff saw, with amazement,
the ruins of the once noted place. There were
the demolished battlements of its old fortifications,
visible as they dropped anchor in a quiet
harbor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>They found the population composed of
Spanish and Negro people, of the most advanced
state of dejection. No trade came to
Porto Bello, no ships bothered to run the menace
of her reefs, except for a very rare sailing
sloop which might put in rather than to
face a storm.</p>
<p>It took only a short time to land, and the
crowd which assembled at the decrepit old
shacks near the beach, astonished the boys by
its slovenliness and its apathy. The people
watched but made no effort to be pleasant or to
help them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see so many sickly people?&rdquo;
Nicky asked, and with good cause: hookworm
was prevalent, from a diet that never varied;
and the unclad bodies of the younger children
seemed a very breeding place for sores. The
ragged adults were in a like state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father says that&rsquo;s what comes of this kind
of a life,&rdquo; Cliff declared. &ldquo;These folks never
see anybody but themselves. They don&rsquo;t have
anything to interest them. They just eat, and
sleep and exist, waiting till they die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d stay here, even if I had to
build a canoe and run the risk of the reefs and
the ocean rollers,&rdquo; Tom stated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather
meet my end fighting for life than sitting down
and waiting for the other thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; Nicky agreed. &ldquo;But these
people are just too lazy and dejected to care,
I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;They have lost their self-respect and their
wills,&rdquo; Bill said. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to feel
sorry for them, but I don&rsquo;t, because I was always
of the idea that it&rsquo;s up to every man to
make himself what he wants to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that way,&rdquo; Tom agreed. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
easy, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it isn&rsquo;t easy,&rdquo; Bill nodded, &ldquo;but it
can be done if we stick to it. I always wanted
to have a ranch in Uncle Sam&rsquo;s good old West.
I was down in Peru. Had no money. Just got
enough to live on; but I stuck to my ideas and
kept saying to myself that if I wanted it long
enough and hard enough, and worked for it,
I&rsquo;d get what I had a desire for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you did,&rdquo; admitted Nicky, for he had
been with Bill during the adventure among the
Incas in which Bill had been able to save Cliff&rsquo;s
father and eventually realize his desire for a
ranch. &ldquo;But it was a good deal by good luck,
Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Nicky!&rdquo; chided Tom, while they
waited for Mr. Gray to make some arrangement
with the &ldquo;alcalde,&rdquo; or head man, a sort
of governor of the town. &ldquo;You always say
&lsquo;there is something that looks out for us!&rsquo; and
I&rsquo;m surprised to hear you talk about luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Nicky agreed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t stop
to think. It looked like luck, that Bill, in Peru,
found the eaglet that had Cliff&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s note
tied to its leg.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if you are sure that there is something,
besides just chance,&rdquo; Bill argued, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d see
that sort of something could bring the bird to
where I&rsquo;d find it, and all the rest would come
around through the same sort of purpose, instead
of by pure chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all agreed to that, and Mr. Gray
brought the alcalde to meet them. He was an
elderly man, very sober and impressed with his
dignity, though what he had to be dignified
about Tom and his chums failed to see. However,
with all the show of authority that he
could put into what was really laziness and
vanity, he pretended that he could not give
them the information they sought until he prepared
for an &ldquo;audience&rdquo; in the shabby old shack
which served as his home and office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes me think of the little frog in the
puddle,&rdquo; Tom commented, as they stood about
the beach, trying to be patient while Bill and
Mr. Gray argued and asked questions. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
so swelled up because he has a little authority
that he forgets to be decent or helpful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, if the alcalde chose to be slow in
his help, they found what they wanted in another
way. They had come to Porto Bello to
get information about Mort Beecher. This they
secured through rather strange channels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look what&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; whispered Tom, nodding
his head toward a figure slowly hobbling
along the beach from a decrepit old lean-to
among the palms and the bush.</p>
<p>They all looked, and stared!</p>
<p>Bent with apparent age, halting in his steps,
clad in rags so far beyond repair that they
scarcely covered him respectably, even in that
half-clothed community, came a white man.</p>
<p>His face was covered with a rank, bushy
beard. His figure, when he came close, was seen
to be not only bronzed and roughened as to skin
by exposure, but was, as well, in a pitiful condition
with the ravages of drink. His eyes were
more bleary and unpleasant than had been those
of Henry Morgan. His voice, high and shaky,
whined and implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beach comber,&rdquo; Bill told them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what a white man comes to when he gets
stranded in one of these dead spots, if he lets
himself go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;He looks as if he
has lost his own self-respect, for he isn&rsquo;t even
clean; and he has no will power, I&rsquo;ll bet, or he
wouldn&rsquo;t have stayed here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laziness, drink&mdash;they tell the story,&rdquo; Bill
responded. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d sap the vitality of one of
the old Greek Gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pitiable figure sidled up, whining, a
shaky hand extended in supplication.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d give me a drink!&rdquo; he
whined.</p>
<p>Bill shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the bent figure, which looked
seventy but which might have seen no more
than fifty years of life&mdash;but such a life! &ldquo;No,
nobody ever does. Nor&mdash;a smoke&mdash;not even a
little &rsquo;baccy for me pipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill drew out a sack of tobacco and some thin
papers and shook a little tobacco into one of
the latter. He saw it spilled from the shaking
fingers that tried to roll the paper, and made a
cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo; he asked, offering
a light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, mister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; Nicky inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to recall&mdash;I can&rsquo;t seem to remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at one another. The alcalde came
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is of no account,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;He cannot
help you,&rdquo; he continued in his slow Spanish,
using the words as though he was trying to recall
the proper ones; his usual conversation was
in a degenerate dialect form that he seemed to
feel was too undignified for the occasion of the
visit of such dignitaries. &ldquo;Come away!&rdquo; he
added. &ldquo;Tomorrow I will receive you and talk
to you.&rdquo; He turned on his heel and walked
away.</p>
<p>Bill looked after him and made a wry grimace
of disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you hear
all through the Spanish tropics, &lsquo;tomorrow!&rsquo;&rdquo;
And he might have added that &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; may
also bring its &ldquo;tomorrow,&rdquo; for the hot countries
breed delays and indolence and the slow, dragging
moments seem interminable to the Americans,
with their purposeful, aggressive manner
and their habit of doing things at once!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t spend a night here,&rdquo; Nicky urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;can&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&rdquo; admonished Tom. &ldquo;Look
at this man. He&rsquo;s said &lsquo;can&rsquo;t&rsquo; or &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; to
everything we ask him. That&rsquo;s what &lsquo;can&rsquo;t&rsquo;
gets you to&mdash;it breaks down everything you try
to accomplish. Say &lsquo;we won&rsquo;t!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, &lsquo;we won&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&rdquo; Nicky grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister,&rdquo; Tom turned to the old man, sniffling
and slumped down on the sand as though
unable to sustain himself on his two legs, &ldquo;you
can tell us, I guess, what we want to know. Is
there anybody in this place named Mort
Beecher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked at him dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember any names,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; urged Nicky, &ldquo;was there any white
man besides you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the other responded, &ldquo;I guess you
wouldn&rsquo;t give me another smoke, would you?&rdquo;
He looked toward Bill. &ldquo;Or something to&mdash;&rdquo;
he made a suggestive movement as if tilting a
glass. &ldquo;No&mdash;I guess nobody would give nothing
to me no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was another white man here,&rdquo; Nicky
persisted. &ldquo;Was his name Mort Beecher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall his name. I can&rsquo;t remember if
he ever told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at one another in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been Mort Beecher,&rdquo; Tom asserted
confidently; then he turned to the derelict
again. &ldquo;Did he ever talk about being in
Mexico?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mexico&mdash;Mexico? I ain&rsquo;t sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he ever mention a&mdash;a Golden Sun?&rdquo;
Bill, rolling and retaining a fresh cigarette just
out of reach of the eager fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sun? I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t just&mdash;seems as if maybe
he did, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Bill said, quite gruffly, tossing
the rolled paper contemptuously to the other
who snatched it greedily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait
for the old slow-poke alcalde. We&rsquo;ll go back
to the boat&mdash;I won&rsquo;t spend a night in this sordid
place!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; pleaded Tom, &ldquo;I feel, some way, as
if this man knows it, but he has got into such a
state that he doesn&rsquo;t make even an effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, mister,&rdquo; said Cliff. &ldquo;Try to think
back. Did he stay here a long time? Did he
talk to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it was quite awhile, but I don&rsquo;t know
how long&mdash;I forget. He talked some, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about&mdash;did he talk of his past?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know? It bothers me to think. I
can&rsquo;t think. If I had, maybe&mdash;a bit o&rsquo; drink&mdash;but
I&rsquo;m not sure, even then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Bill,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take him
out to the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what Tom is after,&rdquo; Nicky broke in.
&ldquo;When we give him some food and clean him
up some, maybe we can quiz him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gray, who had been quietly listening,
nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a psychologist,&rdquo; he said, amused at
Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psy&mdash;? Oh, yes, Mr. Gray. Our instructor
at Amadale told us about that. It&rsquo;s studying
people&rsquo;s minds, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded the scholar. &ldquo;Scientists have
watched people and studied them, just as we
study animals, until they have learned that almost
all people will act in much the same way
under certain ways of stimulating them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;We all want to run
when we are scared; we all do, if there is a
fire and a panic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in Cliff, &ldquo;and when we think
about something nice we smile, and if we think
about a lemon, we act and feel almost as though
we tasted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite correct,&rdquo; smiled the scholar. &ldquo;And we
can go further than that, as I believe Tom
guesses. If we say &lsquo;I cannot&rsquo; often enough,
and keep thinking and declaring that we are
victims of fate, and have no chance to get away
from some place, or to succeed, we get ourselves
into almost as bad a condition as this poor
chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how Mr. Whitley put it, once,&rdquo; Tom
conceded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was thinking about.
If we get this man where he is more like a civilized
man and talk about &lsquo;you can&rsquo; and get him
to feeling that he can remember instead of
that he can&rsquo;t&mdash;maybe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than hanging around doing nothing,&rdquo;
Nicky urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try it,&rdquo; Mr. Gray agreed. &ldquo;There
have been many wonders worked by &lsquo;Modern
Magic&rsquo;&mdash;psychology applied to daily life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he inquired of the shaking
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t use it for so long&mdash;Jack&mdash;just
call me Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jack,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;You throw back
those shoulders and step out like a young fellow.
You&rsquo;re going back to civilization, for
awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look of surprise in the dim eyes became
one of pleading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&mdash;I can&rsquo;t hear you right, saying
that! Nobody would bother with an old beach
comber like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we think we&rsquo;re somebody,
and we are going to bother. It not only can
be true, it is true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come and see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the procession started through the indolent
cluster of natives toward the cruiser&rsquo;s
tender.</p>
<p>They were going to try modern magic.</p>
<p>But Jack held back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be going to take me out on that
fine boat&mdash;and feed me, and treat me like a
white man!&rdquo; he demurred, unable to believe in
his good angels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly are;&rdquo; asserted Bill. &ldquo;And loan
you decent clothes, and treat you like a king!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>He had hardly finished when Jack turned on
his heel and started away; over his shoulder,
in his whining tones, he called to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wait&mdash;I got to bathe me first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magic was already working!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">MODERN MAGIC</span></h2>
<p>While the party returned to the cruiser,
Jack, the beach comber, betook himself to a
land-locked lagoon where he proceeded to begin
his return to self-respect by taking his first
bath for a long time. The chums, excited and
with much gusto, assembled a set of clothes to
give him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cliff, Tom and Nicky,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray,
&ldquo;you all know that you feel much better if you
are dressed up when you go among people. It
gives you self-respect. That is the way we will
work with this man: we will build up his idea
that there is something good in him yet, and
then Bill will offer him a chance to go away
from here and work his way back to decency.
Bill says he can use him on his ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to be fine,&rdquo; Tom agreed. &ldquo;And
I guess we will let Cliff&rsquo;s father do most of the
talking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;After we get him on board and feed him
well, we will have a talk with him,&rdquo; Mr. Gray
conceded. &ldquo;At that time, make only what I
would call positive statements&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Cliff said. &ldquo;&lsquo;I can,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; and &lsquo;We will&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;We wish.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly that,&rdquo; Mr. Gray nodded. &ldquo;We will
first substitute a picture in his mind that will
make him feel like his old self. Then we will
make him want something better than this terrible
life he is living, not offering him a reward,
but letting him see that he wants it enough to
make a try for it. Then probably he will try
to remember and tell us what we want to know&mdash;he
will feel that in helping us he is helping
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; declared Nicky. &ldquo;I know we
will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trio rowed to the lagoon with the bundle
of clothes and when Jack had them on he
seemed to take on a different look; and, as if
he felt already more like a man, he stood up
straighter and his shoulders did not hunch down
so much.</p>
<p>After a good meal and his first decent shave
for, perhaps, years, he looked and acted like a
different person&mdash;and declared that he felt that
way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;You want to get away from here, of course!&rdquo;
Bill said, when they were all on deck, Bob,
the Colon pilot, and Andy, the engineer, watching
in the background, much interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Mr. Gray stated
quietly. &ldquo;You might find somebody who would
help you along. Certainly, in such a case, you
want to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I do!&rdquo; declared Jack&mdash;and the voluntary
change from indecision to assertion
showed that the experiment was succeeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll see that you get to my ranch, in
Colorado,&rdquo; Bill said, and they all showed some
surprise at the sudden movement Jack made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colorado!&rdquo; he almost yelled. &ldquo;I was there
once&mdash;a long time&mdash;I can&rsquo;t remember&mdash;it was
before I got down and out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember it all when you see Colorado,
with its ranges and its painted rocks and
its wonderful, soft sunshine, and its fine
people,&rdquo; Mr. Gray broke in, quickly taking advantage
of this recollection, and using it to
stimulate memories. &ldquo;When you get there you
will remember some of your old friends and
you will find a lot to enjoy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Jack nodded, and his face took on a reflective
look. Bill, and the chums, watching Mr. Gray
as well as Jack, saw a slight shake of the
scholar&rsquo;s head and decided not to interrupt the
flow of old Jack&rsquo;s thought. They wanted Jack
to think of the past.</p>
<p>Finally he asked Bill several questions about
old range locations and Bill answered as well
as he could, about a rather strange, and to him
unfamiliar, part of the state.</p>
<p>Then, gently, by suggesting ideas to Jack,
Mr. Gray got him to tell some incidents of range
life that he recollected, and then went on from
that, letting Jack talk as much as he would,
to get from him the story of the past. It seemed
to become even more clear as he talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is natural,&rdquo; Mr. Gray explained later.
&ldquo;We never forget anything. It&rsquo;s all hidden
somewhere in our minds. But we keep track
of things that interest us most and &lsquo;forget&rsquo; or
bury, the others. But if we try hard enough,
and practice and keep at it, we can recall anything
we want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally&mdash;and it took time!&mdash;they got Jack to
talk about his life in Porto Bello, not insisting
on knowing how he came there, for he had
&ldquo;gone to the dogs&rdquo; at that time and his brain
was so befuddled by lust and bad habits that
he had simply fallen into a state of indolence
and drifted there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>They worked hard to get him to recall when
Mort Beecher arrived, and after a time, Tom,
by a fortunate remark, opened the gates of
memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he get shipwrecked?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I recall,&rdquo; Jack said, accepting a fresh
smoke. &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;my lad, I recall it plain.
There was a great storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting into the spirit of excitement as his
story unfolded, he related the broad details of
a great storm during which a boat had been,
by the whim of tide and wind, swept over the
barrier reefs and into calmer water. Of her occupants,
three men, one alone swam to shore
through the shark-ridden waters. It was Mort
Beecher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and me, we got chummy,&rdquo; Mort&rsquo;s acquaintance
told them, while they listened with
avidity. &ldquo;But we took to using liquor too free,
and I know he talked a heap to me, but only
when he was &lsquo;fired up&rsquo; with this native poison
we have to use. I wasn&rsquo;t in condition to listen
and so I can&rsquo;t tell you nothing. I don&rsquo;t remember.
But we stayed here, going from bad to
worse, till a few days since&mdash;I don&rsquo;t recall just
what day, but another man come here from a
sloop that lay-to off the reef, and he looked for
a man named Mort Beecher&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I recall
his name, come to think, I heard him ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he wouldn&rsquo;t have nothing to do with me&mdash;who
would&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;We would, so forget that sort of talk!&rdquo; commanded
Bill. &ldquo;Well, he only wanted Mort&mdash;for
some private business, maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be, but I don&rsquo;t recall. I didn&rsquo;t hear
him. He gave Mort some money and Mort gave
me a lot of&mdash;you know&mdash;&rdquo; he lifted a hand as
if it held a bottle, tilting back his hand, &ldquo;and
I went off and didn&rsquo;t care, so long as I got what
I come to crave for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they went away, back to the boat, I suppose,&rdquo;
Mr. Gray asserted. Jack nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we want to find out where they went,&rdquo;
began Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mort was my pal while he was here,&rdquo; Jack
said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember nothing, but if it&rsquo;s
account of the law, or anything, I won&rsquo;t help
you to track down a pal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No decent man would, unless his pal had
done wrong!&rdquo; agreed Mr. Gray. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t
after him. We don&rsquo;t know of anything he has
done that is wrong. But we think he can help
us to locate the sister of our Tom, here&mdash;&rdquo; he
related briefly the circumstances of her disappearance.
&ldquo;As a decent, self-respecting man,
you want to help us all you can, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack nodded sturdily. The appeal had its
effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;But I wasn&rsquo;t in condition
to pay &rsquo;tention and I can&rsquo;t remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You recall him talking about Mexico&mdash;&rdquo; suggested
Mr. Gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mexico&mdash;Mexico&mdash;I can&rsquo;t just seem to&mdash;maybe
he did, but I don&rsquo;t recollect what he
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something about the Golden Sun&mdash;&rdquo; suggested
Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;Golden&mdash;the Golden Sun&mdash;&rdquo; Jack said,
trying to screw up his forehead in his effort to
rebuild the old story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golden Sun&mdash;he used to talk about it a lot,&rdquo;
said Mr. Gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golden Sun&mdash;was it, maybe&mdash;I don&rsquo;t just&mdash;let
me think&mdash;I was too fuddled to notice when
he used to brag and boast,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he bragged how he had found
some money that he had hidden,&rdquo; Bill broke in,
referring to his supposition that Mort had hidden
the loot from the mine, gone back to get it,
taken it to Colon and wasted it in riotous living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did brag&mdash;I recall that well,&rdquo; Jack acknowledged.
&ldquo;Seems to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just let it come to you&mdash;it will! You may
have been &lsquo;under the weather&rsquo; but you heard it
all&mdash;it made an impression on you. You do remember
it. It will all come back!&rdquo; Mr. Gray
was making suggestions almost in the way a
hypnotist does when he is putting someone to
sleep, only he was using the principle rightly,
to awaken a man&rsquo;s memories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes! There was a Golden Sun,&rdquo; Jack
declared. &ldquo;It was a&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it a mine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Nicky incautiously. &ldquo;Remember,
Bill, Toosa said it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, feeling
the glare of Tom&rsquo;s and Cliff&rsquo;s warning eyes.
He subsided, crimson with disgust at his carelessness,
for Jack turned with a blank face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You see; I don&rsquo;t
re&mdash;I can&rsquo;t be sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gray did not change his expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s not worry about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
must have told you it was the Golden Sun mine&mdash;and
that might be true. Nicky referred to
something an old Indian said&mdash;the Indian
thought the Golden Sun might be a girl, a name
applied to a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl?&rdquo; said Jack, a blank look on his face.
&ldquo;Was it a girl? I don&rsquo;t recall&mdash;I&rsquo;ve tried. I
want to help you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; declared Mr. Gray, &ldquo;and
you will. As soon as it comes to you clearly&mdash;and
it will!&mdash;you can tell us. Now, go and lie
down and have your afternoon siesta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Siesta!&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;On cushions! In good
clo&rsquo;es! With my stomach full! And yesterday
I laid under a palm tree and roasted and sweat
and starved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Bill rose to show him where he could take his
nap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to remember!&rdquo; said Jack, rather pitifully
and huskily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it may
mean for you&mdash;but you&rsquo;ve been decent and more
than I deserve&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Tom declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d do as much
for us, if it was the other way &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; agreed Jack. &ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll try
to think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; said Nicky ruefully,
when Jack was out of hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t remember
what Mr. Gray said about being positive&mdash;and
you denied what he said and shook
his confidence, but he&rsquo;s trying, and he will succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody succeeds if they keep trying on
a certain line,&rdquo; Cliff stated, and then they
waited&mdash;but not long. Suddenly Jack came on
his shaky legs, almost babbling in his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just come to me!&rdquo; he said eagerly.
&ldquo;Listen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they soon saw that &ldquo;it&rdquo; had &ldquo;come to
him&rdquo; in full.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">PART OF THE SECRET</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Men in tropical places don&rsquo;t ask each other
questions about their business any more than
the cowmen do on the range,&rdquo; Jack began. &ldquo;That
fellow, Mort, was like all of us. He didn&rsquo;t say
much when he was himself; but when he got&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy!&rdquo; suggested Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jack grinned, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call it that.
Instead of being happy, he got to weeping, and
wailing and crying on my shoulder. It was
thinking about that and what he said that made
me remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They settled themselves, under the hot afternoon
sun, to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was after two days and nights,&rdquo; Jack went
on, &ldquo;Mort was weeping about having so much
money and then not having any and getting so
he had to work as a sailor, and get wrecked in
this forsaken hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember it all clearly, at last!&rdquo; commented
Mr. Gray.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; Jack nodded. &ldquo;Mort told me,
then, he had been in Mexico and I recall that
now. He said, between crying and looking for
sympathy, what a shame it was that he had
only took&mdash;let me see, how did he put it?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited, as patiently, as they could, although
it was all that Nicky could do to keep
still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! He said, &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t it a shame I was
scared to go back and get the rest? I only took
one little sack of gold dust&mdash;and there was
mules loaded with it and it was all safe for me
to get, but I was too scared to go and get it.&rsquo;
That&rsquo;s what he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can help build up what he meant,&rdquo; suggested
Bill. &ldquo;We were told about the looting
of the Dead Hope Mine by bandits and how
Mort drove the mules away.&rdquo; He was about
to continue but a warning look from Mr. Gray
caused him to let Jack resume his own story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d had a good time on the money
but when it ran out&mdash;but you know about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They nodded and waited while he reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;Yes, this is
the way of it&mdash;Mort said if he could find a little
girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he call her?&rdquo; broke in Tom, unable
to restrain his eagerness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t call her any name,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;But he said &lsquo;if I could find a little girl
that&mdash;that the&mdash;er&mdash;Indians took&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off and concentrated his mind on
what he wanted to recall.</p>
<p>Tom had his lips parted to prompt, and
Nicky was fidgeting in his folding chair until it
squeaked and almost folded up; but Cliff, with
one finger at his ear, caressing it, made a sign
that neither chum could ignore&mdash;the call of the
Mystery Boys&rsquo; order for a council. They folded
their arms in token of agreement and then Cliff
communicated by a touch of one finger on his
chin&mdash;&ldquo;Keep quiet!&rdquo; They nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did the Indians get her&mdash;did he say?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Gray in a gentle, quiet tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it seems as though he did&mdash;let me
think! Yes. He said that he took her all
through the mountains all right, and he thought
he would get a reward for saving her when the
bandits attacked the mine. I recollect that real
plain. Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had to stop often to bring up the memories,
but one thought led to the next and soon
he was in the midst of his narrative.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;The bandits were hot on his trail, and that
is why he didn&rsquo;t have time to stop and claim
a reward or to return the little girl. She had
golden hair, and was right pretty, he said. But
he had to take her to the coast, with what money
he could bring in the sack of dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold dust!&rdquo; commented Bill. &ldquo;And the rest
is still there, maybe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe!&rdquo; agreed Jack. &ldquo;Anyway, he said he
and the little girl went at last to the coast and
wanted to get a ship to take them to America,
but there wasn&rsquo;t any sailing right then, and the
bandit chief was in the town, in disguise, and
Mort was so scared he&rsquo;d be shot that he took
the little girl and went on a coasting boat bound
for different ports. He dyed the little girl&rsquo;s hair
and made himself look different and kept her
in the stateroom of the little ship he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that way, as Mort had related and as Jack
recollected, bit by bit, the two had gone slowly
down the coast. Always he was oppressed by
terror, first of being discovered with the little
girl, second, of being caught by the bandits he
had fooled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day he told me, the steward come to
him, said the little girl was crying and said she
wasn&rsquo;t his little girl and she wanted to go home.
That scared Mort so much that when the ship
hove-to right near the San Blas country, which
is all islands where the San Blas Indians live,
he got a sailor to lower a boat in the night and
set him and the little girl onto shore.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Toosa told us to seek him among the San
Blas Indians,&rdquo; said Tom, under his breath.
Nicky and Cliff nodded and bent forward even
more eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems, from what I recall, he said they were
landed on a right small island where some families
of the Indians lived, and for a time they
was all right, because the little girl was real
smart and had a lot of pity for the sickly Indians
and told them what to do to be better and
they did, even young as she was to tell them
how to behave, and they got better from washing
more and living decenter, and anyhow, she
got to be real well-liked; but Mort hated the
idle place and no fun or anything to spend
money on&mdash;you know what I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They nodded and he continued the little more
he had to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was like Margery,&rdquo; Tom said, referring
to his lost sister. &ldquo;She used to play nurse
to her dolls and say she was going to grow up
to be a nurse and cure people, and she was always
asking questions about how doctors made
people well, and how people ought to do to
keep well. My sister was the smartest girl of
ten I ever saw, and awfully grown up for her
age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find her,&rdquo; declared Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jack completed his story. &ldquo;All I recall
is that Mort said one morning he woke up
to find the little girl was gone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; chorused the chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made away with,&rdquo; Jack nodded. &ldquo;Mort
didn&rsquo;t know where. Seems maybe the other Indians
heard about her curing folks and wanted
to be doctored&mdash;or maybe they made her like a
goddess or something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inland Indians must have heard of her
and taken her,&rdquo; Bill suggested. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put
it past them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, as Mort said, between his weeping,
it was hard on him, after he had took such
good care of her and been so careful&mdash;because
now he&rsquo;d never be able to get hold of the Golden
Sun mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Golden Sun mine!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Did
she have papers or anything, did he say&mdash;was
she the owner of the mine?&mdash;did my dad discover
a mine and give her the papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that I can&rsquo;t tell. Mort said by losing
the little girl he lost the Golden Sun mine and
so he went from there to Colon and rioted on
what he had&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all I remember!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;That makes everything very plain to me,&rdquo;
declared Mr. Gray. &ldquo;Henry Morgan said that
all Mort could talk to him about was the Golden
Sun, but Henry thought it might be the little
girl, or a mine, he didn&rsquo;t know what, when we
discussed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mort ran away with the child,&rdquo; Bill contributed.
&ldquo;And from what Jack, here, has told
us, I think that Henry Morgan knew, from what
Mort may have told him back in Mexico, that
Tom&rsquo;s father had discovered some mine or
knew of one and either gave his daughter the
title to it or else told her, and no one else, where
it was located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Nicky nodded vigorous agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Henry Morgan, when he found
out we were trying to trace my sister,&rdquo; Tom
said, &ldquo;was so anxious to be one of the party.
He wants to get the information before we find
out anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he wants to get it all for himself,&rdquo;
Nicky declared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he intended that
we should ever find out anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Cliff said. &ldquo;But why did he want us to
go to Toosa first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so&mdash;if the little girl knew about the
mine,&rdquo; Nicky agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this may be it,&rdquo; Bill suggested. &ldquo;You
know, Toosa was a great medicine man and
witch-doctor, and he knew a lot about Henry
Morgan and Mort Beecher when they were in
his country earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;He thought Toosa would
know how to locate Mort better than anybody
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he found out that Mort might
be in Porto Bello, he deserted us,&rdquo; stated Cliff.
&ldquo;The mean, contemptible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Names won&rsquo;t help,&rdquo; Bill suggested. &ldquo;What
we want is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Action!&rdquo; cried Nicky, leaping to his feet,
upsetting his camp chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Action is the word!&rdquo; Bill conceded. &ldquo;Henry
Morgan got here while you folks on the cruiser
came up-river to rescue us. Now he&rsquo;s been here,
probably convinced Mort that they could do
more together than alone&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went to the San Blas Indians!&rdquo; cried Tom.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to hurry and get there, too, before
he can locate my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Gray. &ldquo;How do we
know that he and Mort Beecher have not gone
back to Mexico to secure the hidden money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, we&rsquo;d not care about that; we must
get to the San Blas islands,&rdquo; Tom cried. &ldquo;We
must find out about Margery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To that they agreed, and with Jack as a passenger,
the cruiser wasted no time in clearing
the port and turning her nose toward the
archipelago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">A COLD RECEPTION</span></h2>
<p>The San Blas Indians live on islands of the
archipelago which guards the coast close to the
line between Columbia and Panama. Most of
the islands are quite small and are occupied,
in some cases, by no more than three families;
in others by more, and on the largest of the
islands there is a city, close-packed huts crowding
each other with very little free space. On
this island, really the capital, the Indians live
in goodly numbers, getting their food and doing
much of their work by going to the mainland
shore in canoes.</p>
<p>Before they approached the San Blas island
colonies, Tom spoke of a matter that had been
worrying him a great deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have a plan,&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;If we go and ask about a girl&mdash;my sister&mdash;they
won&rsquo;t tell us, especially if they have kept
her a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Cliff acknowledged.
&ldquo;We could say we are traders, couldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would not help us to get to the inland
tribes, if she is not on the islands,&rdquo; Bill objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could pretend we are looking for gold,&rdquo;
Nicky contributed.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray shook his head. They were all, except
Andy at the engine and the colored pilot,
Bob, at the wheel, seated in the little cabin eating
dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mr. Gray said with his headshake.
&ldquo;The San Blas Indians are not much interested
in gold. There is another tribe, the Chucunaque
Indians, living on the mainland, and in the interior,
who are really a part of the same original
stock as the San Blas people, and they are
very decidedly antagonistic to white people for
the very reason that Nicky has suggested.
These Indians think that white men are all trying
to find gold, and the Indians say, according
to the information I have, that gold is what
has destroyed the Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; Nicky declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They argue somewhat to this effect: the
white man wants gold. He comes among the
Indians to look for it. He bribes them with
his fiery liquors and he fights them and degrades
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, too,&rdquo; Cliff nodded. &ldquo;Whenever
you see Indians after white men have been in
their country, you see a decayed race. Look
at our own &lsquo;Redskins&rsquo;&mdash;they have lost their
country and live on reservations and only since
the Government saw what was happening and
did something to protect them have they been
able to protect themselves and try to get back
some of their self-respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly what the Chucunaque Indians
are afraid of,&rdquo; Mr. Gray told them. &ldquo;The
Government of Columbia has tried to colonize
their country but they have fought every effort
and the Government had to give up because the
Indians won&rsquo;t let a white man get into their
lands. They have drawn a sort of sacred ring
around themselves and no one can get into the
country without their permission, and once in,
will never be heard of again unless the Indians
let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t look very promising,&rdquo; Tom
said despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we had a plan, as you said,&rdquo; Nicky
said hopefully, &ldquo;only&mdash;what kind of a plan
would fit that sort of people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack, who kept his face shaved and clean
and who took pride in his new respectability,
had been listening without comment; he spoke
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I do know, from Porto Bello and
other places,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that the Indians are
all pretty sickly. Now, back in Colorado, I used
to be a sort of &lsquo;jack-leg&rsquo; doctor, a rough-and-ready
kind of a doctor, I admit&mdash;but I knew
something about medicine and so on. If we
had some medicines, now, and any books&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; cried Tom, exultantly.
&ldquo;We have a medicine kit on board, and it tells
how to use things&mdash;first aid and all that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have plenty of zinc ointment, and
other remedies that are useful for skin diseases
and so on,&rdquo; Mr. Gray declared. &ldquo;I know enough
about tropical exploration to provide those
things, and we have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, maybe I could pose as a great medicine
man,&rdquo; Jack suggested. &ldquo;Not that I would
be, you see, but I could do some things, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we know first aid,&rdquo; Nicky cried, eagerly.
&ldquo;The Scouts all know first aid and how to take
care of hurts and stings and cuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom found an objection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they would only let you go through the
guarded circle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And where would
the rest of us get in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could take me as a sort of second-string
medicine man,&rdquo; Bill spoke up. &ldquo;Two of us
could do all that was necessary. If we found
Tom&rsquo;s sister at all, either two could help to get
her free or it would be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Gray. &ldquo;Numbers would
not count; we couldn&rsquo;t expect to fight against
them in their own country. Those Indians still
use the old, primitive bows and poisoned arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three chums looked at one another disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as though we&rsquo;ll be left out,&rdquo; Nicky
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make the best of it, then,&rdquo;
Cliff stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, the main thing is to locate my
sister,&rdquo; Tom added.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it cast a damper on their usually
gay spirits for in every previous adventure
the chums had been inseparable, had participated
in every exciting episode and had
really brought every adventure to a happy termination.</p>
<p>When they talked it over, however, they decided
to make the best of the situation as it
then appeared, burying their personal desires
for the good of their cause.</p>
<p>Toward sunset they came to one of the first
small islands of the archipelago, and saw three
huts nestling among the palms. From a distance,
with glasses, they made out a number of
people standing on the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be watching for us,&rdquo; Nicky
declared. &ldquo;How do they know we are coming,
do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Henry Morgan has been here and
told them we might come,&rdquo; Cliff suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Tom, excitedly pressing the
glasses into Cliff&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re running
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get ready for a welcome,&rdquo; Nicky offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Cliff, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re tumbling into three
canoes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the canoes with my naked eye,&rdquo; Tom
agreed. &ldquo;They are pushing off from shore&mdash;they&rsquo;re
paddling away as fast as they can go
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a fact, and when the cruiser came
near enough to lay-to and hail, there was no
response and when the chums, in the boat,
rowed to the rough corral beach there was not
a soul on the island!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo; Nicky declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to like company!&rdquo; Cliff
added.</p>
<p>Tom made no comment as they rowed back.</p>
<p>At a half dozen other islands, the next day,
the same thing happened. Small groups gathered
to watch their approach, then, as though
driven by some fear of them, scrambled into
canoes and disappeared among the islands or
toward the mainland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they are as afraid of white
people as all that?&rdquo; Cliff wondered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all keep out of sight when we come in
sight of the next island, only have Bob, who is
dark and might look at a distance like an Indian,
on deck,&rdquo; whispered Nicky. Cliff and Tom
agreed, and when Mr. Gray, Bill and Jack, all
three puzzled, heard the plan, they agreed.</p>
<p>The change in their plan seemed to make no
difference. As they came within sight of the
next islet, canoes filled and were driven hastily
into hiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; Cliff stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; Bill acknowledged, and Jack conceded
the same thing.</p>
<p>Tom still remained mute, his face very sober.</p>
<p>Finally they reached a fairly clear harbor at
the largest of the islands. While they dropped
anchor they watched anxiously, for there were
many canoes, of different sizes, busily traversing
the waterway between the island and the
distant shore.</p>
<p>Except for giving the cruiser a wide berth,
however, the canoes appeared not to know that
it existed.</p>
<p>All the next day the company waited for the
approach of a canoe. With the early sunrise a
fleet of canoes, filled with women&mdash;who seemed
to do all of the paddling and all other work&mdash;set
out for the mainland, paying no attention
whatever to the cruiser. At evening the fleet
came back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to do something,&rdquo; Nicky urged,
always anxious to act. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s land and find
out what&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot hurry an Indian,&rdquo; Mr. Gray
counseled. &ldquo;We must wait to see what they
will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More can be gained by patience than by
forcing them to move,&rdquo; Bill supplemented the
older man&rsquo;s counsel.</p>
<p>And so they let another day pass.</p>
<p>Then a canoe approached. It contained three
of the older Indians, dark, steady, stolid men.
They made gestures indicating that they desired
the boat to go away.</p>
<p>Bill, standing at the bow, beckoned to them,
and held out for them to see, some very flashy
glass ornaments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Big Chief!&rdquo; he called, in Spanish.</p>
<p>The canoe lay quiet; the men did not move.</p>
<p>A long half-hour passed.</p>
<p>Then the men nodded, paddled closer and
waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Present&mdash;for Big Chief!&rdquo; repeated Bill, and
bent low over the coaming and rail to hand
them several brightly polished silver belt-buckles,
a glittering glass pendant, and some
strings of gay beads. He handed them down
into the canoe.</p>
<p>The men considered them without expression.
Then one looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want visit chief&mdash;give more present&mdash;show
Indians how get well. We bring big medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the ornaments but hiding any show
of appreciation, the men paddled swiftly toward
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it works!&rdquo; Bill said, rather nervously,
dragging an old cigar lighter from his
pocket and snapping its steel wheel with his
thumb to ignite its wick so he could light a
cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darn these things!&rdquo; he grumbled when it
failed. &ldquo;Always out of whack! And matches
are so wet you get <i>one</i> to strike out of a whole
packet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have it,&rdquo; suggested Tom. &ldquo;I can
turn the flint and clip the wick. I used to do
it for my&mdash;for my father.&rdquo; Bill nodded, handed
him the implement and struck match after
match, finally getting a light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Tom worked over the lighter until it operated
three out of four times, filled it with gasoline
from the drip of the slightly opened carbureter
drain, and, carefully closing the drain again,
slipped the lighter in his pocket as Andy called
him to help get out the after anchor, because
a huge, stormy cloud was rapidly coming over
and the cruiser must be well secured. Tom forgot
all about the lighter in the ensuing excitement,
for a terrific tropical wind and rain came
up and everyone had plenty to do to keep the
cruiser from dragging onto reefs.</p>
<p>Early the next morning the canoe approached
again; the storm was all over and the harbor
was like glass as the roughly hewn craft slid
gently up to the cruiser&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>All of the party assembled on deck to see
what would happen.</p>
<p>One of the older trio in the canoe stood erect
and surveyed the company with expressionless,
stolid gaze. Finally he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who doctor?&rdquo; he asked. They pointed to
Jack.</p>
<p>The man nodded, beckoned to Jack. The
latter climbed, in his neat, borrowed clothes,
into the canoe.</p>
<p>Then the trio waited. &ldquo;They want the presents,&rdquo;
Bill suggested and he and Tom hurried
to secure more gifts with which, if possible, to
win the good will of the chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>When they returned, instead of taking the
gifts, the men beckoned and gestured for them
to descend into the canoe, and so it was that
Tom, Bill and Jack were taken to the island
while the others, with what patience they could,
mastered their disappointment and waited.</p>
<p>Noon came, and no one returned. Afternoon
wore on and still nothing happened, no canoe
put off from shore.</p>
<p>Just before dusk the fleet of canoes carrying
the women who did the washing, prepared
the food and other things on the mainland,
came home; still the trio did not return to the
cruiser. Cliff and Nicky did not voice their
worry for they saw the uneasiness in Mr.
Gray&rsquo;s expression and did not wish to add to
his concern.</p>
<p>Just before dark the canoe returned. Tom
had hardly gotten on deck with his two companions
and the canoe disappeared in the dusk
when Nicky and Cliff demanded an explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Tom started his explanation, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think it looks very good. They took us
to shore, and the island is fairly packed with
the huts they live in, and there is a big, sort
of open, hut in the middle, and they took us
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief lived there, I guess,&rdquo; Nicky broke
in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Tom nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;He was
in a hammock, lying there as though he were
asleep, and he had a lot of his chief men sitting
on low stools around his hammock. The
rest of the place was simply packed with people,
men and women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a sight!&rdquo; Cliff declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was. And they took us to stools in the
center and let us sit down. There we sat and
sat and sat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Nicky agreed. &ldquo;They keep you
waiting for the chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally Bill got tired of it and stood up and
made a &lsquo;talk&rsquo; in his best Spanish, with signs
and everything. He pointed to Jack, and said
he was a doctor&mdash;of course we had given the
chief our gifts at first and he didn&rsquo;t bother
to thank us. Bill made a good speech, if they
understood it; they didn&rsquo;t show whether they
did or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wooden Indians was a good name for
them,&rdquo; Bill said, coming up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we sat and sat and sat some more,&rdquo;
Tom went on. &ldquo;It got to be noon and the place
began to get pretty strong, with the heat and
the sweating and packed people. But nothing
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;It got so bad, finally,&rdquo; Bill took up the story,
&ldquo;I felt like I had to have a smoke, and so did
Jack. They hadn&rsquo;t brought any sick people
to be doctored, or made a move. And nobody
talked. So I hauled out my stuff and rolled
two cigarettes. And then&mdash;here&rsquo;s where Tom
comes in. Go ahead, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill didn&rsquo;t have any matches&mdash;he&rsquo;d used up
all his packet the night before,&rdquo; Tom explained.
&ldquo;So he felt around and looked blank and Jack
had one match and he struck it and the head
was wet so it didn&rsquo;t go off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was bad,&rdquo; Nicky declared. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d
suspect you weren&rsquo;t very good makers of
magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; Bill urged, and motioned to Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t anything I did,&rdquo; Tom demurred.
&ldquo;It was just having forgotten that I fixed Bill&rsquo;s
cigar lighter&mdash;and when we needed it we had it.
I pulled it out and flicked it and it lit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic!&rdquo; chuckled Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did it surprise them?&rdquo; demanded Bill,
knowing that he answered himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were as excited as babies with new
pinwheels,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;The chief beckoned to
me and I had to go over and light the thing
a half a hundred times, and then let him try&mdash;and
of course he couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s stock went up about two million
points!&rdquo; grinned Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it did help us,&rdquo; Tom became serious.
&ldquo;That is&mdash;it helped us to learn what we were
wondering about&mdash;why everybody runs from us
on the other islands. But it makes our problem
that much harder, too, at the same time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; demanded Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; Tom explained, despondently.
&ldquo;The chief called a man who speaks some
Spanish and had him tell us. Two white men
have come here already, a few days ago. I
think it was Henry Morgan and Mort Beecher.
They said they were great doctors, and they
did have some medicines and they put stuff on
the Indians and told them they would be cured
of their sores and so on in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They came in a sailing sloop,&rdquo; Bill added.
&ldquo;It landed them and went on down the coast
toward South America, but it is coming back
in a week or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what makes that mean anything to us,
beyond the fact that they got here first?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry and Mort&mdash;if that&rsquo;s who it was&mdash;told
the Indians they are the only true medicine
men, and they said that men would come soon
and pretend to be as great&mdash;but they would be
evil and undo all the good. And this is the
diabolical part of their story&mdash;&rdquo; he paused and
bent forward impressively, to add:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said that if their medicine did not
cure&mdash;it is because the evil ones that are coming&mdash;us!&mdash;are
working with devil-medicine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good grief!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicky. &ldquo;That is
wicked talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has terrified the Indians,&rdquo; Bill agreed.
&ldquo;And it was only because Tom&rsquo;s trick with the
lighter caught the chief&rsquo;s fancy and impressed
him that he told us. He warned us to go away.
He can&rsquo;t trust us, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does make it hard for us to do anything!&rdquo;
Cliff declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard&mdash;&rdquo; Nicky sniffed. &ldquo;But not impossible&mdash;never
say die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tom cried. &ldquo;But what will we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Cliff, dejectedly, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE JUNGLE OPENS ITS ARMS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting for something to happen is the
hardest thing in the world,&rdquo; Tom declared. He,
and Nicky and Cliff sat in the shade of a small
awning on the forward deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially waiting when nothing does happen,&rdquo;
Nicky put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything will happen unless
we make it happen,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;The Indians
didn&rsquo;t pay the least bit of attention to us all
day yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Cliff argued. &ldquo;The day before, when
Tom won the chief&rsquo;s interest with the cigar
lighter, the big man told him that the Indians
don&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he thinks he has done all that he
needs to,&rdquo; Tom said, dejectedly. &ldquo;They are
just waiting for us to go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Bill and Jack get some results,&rdquo;
Nicky said. The two he mentioned had carried
gifts to shore early in the morning of this,
the second day following the audience with the
chief; they hoped to win him over, to get his
confidence. But while they tried they felt, from
the start, that it was a hopeless attempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had something to do!&rdquo; Nicky
argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose we could row to the
mainland?&rdquo; Cliff suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask,&rdquo; Nicky cried, jumping up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could find out what all the women do
after they paddle over,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;If we report
their customs, Mr. Gray ought to be willing
to let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They asked, and pleaded when Mr. Gray hesitated.
They promised to be careful; they urged
their case, agreeing to report customs and
everything they saw. The elderly scholar did
not feel like accompanying them himself, for
he hated the humidity and the sun&rsquo;s terrific
heat; he told them that if Andy would go along&mdash;Bob
had taken the two white men in the boat,
and had brought it back&mdash;they might row a
ways up the river and they could see across
the wide expanse of the inner lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Andy told them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
tinker with my motor&mdash;there&rsquo;s one spark plug
that misses, and I want to clean the whole set
and adjust the timing of my motor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trio showed disappointment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take the spare rifle and get Bob to row you
over,&rdquo; suggested the engineer; but they demurred
among themselves. Bob, not because
he was colored, but because he had a gruff,
rather surly disposition, was not a pleasant
companion on an exploring trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any harm in rowing up the river,&rdquo;
Andy said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get out of the boat and
you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They promised with the utmost sincerity
and meant fully to obey the order. The pull
across the hot lagoon taxed them, for the sun
was hot and even though they took turns rowing
the boat was slow and they were quite
wearied when, early in the afternoon, they came
to a place opposite the spot where the women
had beached their canoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can just draw up on the sand and eat
our lunch,&rdquo; Nicky suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s shady under
those mangroves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Cliff conceded that no harm could
come of that. As they watched the women they
saw that the washing for the various families
was being done. It was conducted in a way
quite like that they had seen in Jamaica, and
among other tribes: the women, standing knee
deep in the river, beat and pounded the clothes
in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty hard on clothing,&rdquo; Cliff said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;The clothes they have aren&rsquo;t in such good
condition that they could stand any sort of
scrubbing, anyhow,&rdquo; Tom agreed. &ldquo;It certainly
is a primitive sight&mdash;but look! They&rsquo;re running
and hiding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they approached the women, the latter
dropped what they had, leaving the things to
drift in the slow current, and raced across the
beach and into the heavy jungle. The jungle
came close to the water and was as thick and
seemingly impenetrable as any tropical growth
could be; yet the women disappeared into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; Cliff cried. &ldquo;Their things
will all be lost&mdash;row over faster, Nicky. We&rsquo;ll
save the clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spent a busy half hour recovering the
pieces of cloth from the water and piling them
on shore. Though they called and tried to make
the hidden watchers understand that they
meant them no harm, the boys got no response.
Rather disgusted with the Indians, they sat
under a shady clump of brush, surrounded by
vividly colored birds and butterflies and ate their
lunch of sweet yams, a tin of meat and a thermos
bottle of warm cocoa. Not a very appetizing
lunch to one accustomed to refrigerators
and well-stocked markets, but, to tropical appetites,
after a long row, a meal which was
eaten with gusto.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see butterflies like these?&rdquo;
asked Nicky, pointing to a bluish-silver beauty
whose wings seemed iridescent in the sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that father would love to have some
of them,&rdquo; Cliff said. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any of these
great silvery ones, or the deep, blue-winged
kind, in his collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither have I!&rdquo; declared Nicky. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
catch some!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the rifle along, if you go into the
brush,&rdquo; warned Tom. &ldquo;We might meet a jaguar
or a tapir or some old thing&mdash;or snakes!&mdash;watch
out for snakes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff put the rifle under his arm, and the
trio, darting after the bright-winged insects,
raced up the beach, and into the heavy fringe
of brush.</p>
<p>They kept quite close together, at first, but
when they had thrust a little way into the dense
growth they saw that they came out into a fairy-land,
and, forgetting all caution in the thrill
of the beautiful sight, they paused for a moment
and then pressed forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>They saw none of the Indian women; indeed,
they had forgotten all about them. The dense
growth of brush, matted vines, tangled creepers,
which fringed the river, gave place to great,
lofty open glades of forest grandeur. Trees
like great columns, reared their tall forms upward
from every point, making vast aisles of
gloom between their huge trunks. Overhead
their leaves met and tangled, twined and held
by giant creepers, so that only a dim, softly
diffused light came down to light the magical
scene.</p>
<p>There was, at first, a seeming silence, an awesomely
deep silence; it made the boys stop talking,
or converse in a whisper, feeling some inward
tendency to be still. Gradually, however,
the forest took up its solemn conversation; the
hum of insects became noticeable, the faint
crackle of twigs as some soft-footed denizen of
the deep gloom made wary way along some hidden
trail; the soft plash of a fish in the hidden,
distant river; the twitter of several birds, and
the soft, incessant flutter of bright&mdash;gaudily
colored wings. Most of the tropical birds are
vivid in color but have no song.</p>
<p>A flock of gaily plumed birds whirred by
among the silences above their heads. Cliff
half-automatically lifted the rifle and then let
its barrel drop; they were too beautiful to be
killed, to be dragged down, inert, lifeless, by
a cruel and senseless use of lead. Cliff was a
very humane youth and he destroyed animal
life only for real needs at any time.</p>
<p>Came a glitter and glow before their eyes;
a very battalion of gay butterflies flitted here
and there. Forgetting the silence, with a whoop
they were in pursuit. Cliff dropped the rifle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Here and there, afar and then close, through
the great boles of century-old trees, the pursuit
led them.</p>
<p>Sometimes in eyeshot of one another,
oftener not, they caught the gay little insects.</p>
<p>Finally, with whoop and call, the trio managed
to locate one another and to gather to compare
their catches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have twelve of the blue ones, two silver
ones, six yellow ones, and this burnished gold
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me one of your silver ones for this red
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had six of your blue ones I&rsquo;d trade two
of these golden sunshine ones,&rdquo; Nicky completed
the trio of voices.</p>
<p>The trade was made and they rose to return
to the river.</p>
<p>And then three faces turned to a common
center in dismay.</p>
<p>Cliff looked at Tom and Nicky and they, in
turn, regarded each the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; asked Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your compass, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
asked Tom.</p>
<p>Nicky pulled out the little round case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gravy!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The needle
is stuck. See&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t turn!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s no good, then,&rdquo; Cliff said, hiding
his own misgivings. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t get frightened
and lose all our good sense. Let&rsquo;s sit
down and think how to go about finding our way
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun won&rsquo;t help&mdash;we can&rsquo;t see where it
is,&rdquo; Nicky declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s getting dimmer,&rdquo; Tom stated. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t have too much time before night&mdash;let&rsquo;s
see if we can&rsquo;t find where I dropped the rifle.
Each one go in a different direction, and nick
the trees with your knives so you can get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started off, and, after awhile, a hail
from Tom showed that he had discovered the
previous weapon. But then they all had to return
to the common center and from there, after
meeting, had to go back to the spot where the
rifle lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are we any better off?&rdquo; Nicky wondered.
&ldquo;Which way is &lsquo;out&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can make the Indian women
hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. They ran before&mdash;they won&rsquo;t
come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; said Tom, in a matter-of-fact
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any woods&rsquo; sign in the tropics
to show which is North, or some direction?&rdquo;
demanded Nicky. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t moss grow mostly
on one side of a tree?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;In temperate climates I know some signs,
but I don&rsquo;t see any here,&rdquo; Cliff acknowledged,
spying about him carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Nicky declared, &ldquo;we can shout, in
turn, every half minute, and fire the rifle once
in awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t waste shots,&rdquo; objected Cliff. &ldquo;We
may need&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off, not wishing them
to picture the dangers he began to foresee.</p>
<p>But their minds were quick; however, each
hid his growing uneasiness from his companions
as well as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a rifle with a full magazine,&rdquo; Tom
said stoutly. &ldquo;That will protect us and give
us food until we get out&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve got the
lighter of Bill&rsquo;s to make a fire to cook it on.
We&rsquo;re not so badly off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we get excited and start planning and
running around,&rdquo; Cliff suggested, &ldquo;we will wear
ourselves out and get nowhere. Let&rsquo;s sit here
in this open glade and think. When anybody
has an idea that is good sense, we can try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what looks like a trail yonder,&rdquo; Tom
had used his eyes and he pointed to the near
end of the glade. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it a ways&mdash;it ought
to lead toward the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; asked Nicky. &ldquo;From that end
of the glade or this end?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so&mdash;it is at both sides,&rdquo; conceded
Tom. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try one way for an hour and see
what we see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of that time by Nicky&rsquo;s wrist
watch they retraced their way&mdash;and when darkness
came on, they were still on the other trail,
and weary and excited; but no sight of the river
rewarded their eager gaze, no sound of a response
came back to their loud hallos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; said Cliff. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;d
better pick out trees and get ourselves off the
ground while its light enough to see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But jaguars&mdash;cats can climb trees,&rdquo; Nicky
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re as safe on the ground,&rdquo; Tom urged.
&ldquo;We can gather wood and make a big bonfire
and that will be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the rapidly waning light, gloomy at the
best, they managed to gather broken, half-rotted
twigs, branches, small strips of bark
and dead vines and several logs, back in the
glade.</p>
<p>They made a good pile of them, keeping together,
Cliff with the rifle always at his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s watch-and-watch,&rdquo; he said when they
sat down to stare at the leaping flare of their
fire, keeping quite close to its cheering blaze,
&ldquo;Nicky watches until nine, then Tom, then I
will watch&mdash;two hours for each, unless we all
have to wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Thus, as the day&rsquo;s quiet gave place to the
growing bedlam of the darkness, with hoots
and wails, the strident sounds made by night
insects making an undertone to the occasional
weird voice of a wild beast, the three adventurous
youths made the best of a bad situation
and sat, supperless, by the one bright spot of
safety in that wild place.</p>
<p>The jungle had opened its arms and had
folded them upon its prey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">WASTED EFFORT</span></h2>
<p>When all attempts to persuade the chief to
listen had resulted in a final, and rather angry
order for them to go, Bill and Jack gave up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Bill said. &ldquo;We are stumped.
Let&rsquo;s go to the dock and meet Bob&mdash;he ought
to be back with the boat pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went to the ramshackle wharf made of
old, rotting poles stuck into the water, with old
boards, from some wreckage, loosely laid on
them for a footpath. The dock was seldom used&mdash;only
for the few occasions when government
launches came to the island to transact business
with the chief.</p>
<p>But after a long wait, when Bob failed to
show up, Bill became uneasy and finally hailed
the cruiser by firing his pistol three times.</p>
<p>The boat was too far away for voices to
carry, and also signs could not be distinguished.</p>
<p>Bill and Jack impatient and worried, for they
could not see the small boat anywhere about,
commandeered a canoe and paddled to the
anchored cruiser.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;The boys have not come back,&rdquo; said Mr.
Gray uneasily when they came alongside. He
told how he had given them permission to go
to the river. Andy, summoned, was crestfallen
and alarmed. He related his suggestion to the
youths and Bob said that he had not been asked
to be one of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take the canoe and paddle over,&rdquo;
said Bill. &ldquo;No time to waste. It won&rsquo;t be over-long
till dark.&rdquo; Without further word he and
Jack paddled toward the mainland. They
worked swiftly, for both knew that time was of
supreme importance if any harm had come to
their younger comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think the Indians?&mdash;&rdquo; began Jack.</p>
<p>Bill shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come, anyhow,&rdquo; he stated, pointing
with his paddle to the fleet appearing at
the river mouth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canoes seemed to be bent on avoiding
them, but Bill drew out a soiled but fairly white
handkerchief and waved it, then beckoned. A
canoe containing several younger women veered
closer and the paddles ceased to sweep the
glassy water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see boat&mdash;boys?&rdquo; hailed Bill.</p>
<p>One of the women nodded and pointed back
the way they had come from the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re back there,&rdquo; Bill told Jack. &ldquo;They
must be all right. But we&rsquo;d better go on and
make sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed through the squadron of canoes
and up the river. Long before they reached
the small, sandy beach, they discerned the rowboat,
drawn up on shore. The Indian women
had left it untouched, after a curious examination
of its scanty contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re nowhere around,&rdquo; Bill exclaimed
when they came closer: with tight lips he ran
the canoe into shallow water and vaulted into
the shallows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom&mdash;Nicky&mdash;Cliff!&rdquo; he shouted, and
waited.</p>
<p>The echoes were silent. Jack added his high
pitched call, and they shouted together; but the
jungle held its secret. The boys, at that time,
were two miles beyond hearing, on a trail that
ran almost parallel to the course of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re in the jungle, how will we locate
them?&rdquo; asked Jack. &ldquo;I know something about
these places&mdash;once you get in, you wander and
get further away all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fire our pistols,&rdquo; cried Bill. &ldquo;Push
in, here, as far as we dare go without getting
lost ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>There they shouted and, at intervals, fired
their pistols. But only the silent glades and
the sentinels towering high above heard the
hails and quivered a little to the strange sound
of exploding powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing we can do by waiting here,&rdquo;
Bill said, finally. &ldquo;My idea is to go to the chief
and offer him all we&rsquo;ve got to put out parties
who know the trails, give them torches, and try
to get some trace of what has happened. The
boys are lost. We would be lost in no time,
looking; but the Indians might not. We&rsquo;ll try
it. It&rsquo;s the only thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tired as they were, their paddles fairly flew
as they made their way back toward the
cruiser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the sun is setting in the open, it must be
night back in the jungle,&rdquo; began Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; snapped Bill, refusing to think of
harm and thus lose his hold on his plans. They
delayed at the boat only long enough to give
the details of their discovery to a perturbed
Mr. Gray, a penitent engineer and an excited
colored pilot. Then they paddled for the shore.</p>
<p>Without ceremony they burst in at the
chief&rsquo;s big hut, where he was partaking of his
evening meal.</p>
<p>He listened to Bill&rsquo;s excited story, related in
Spanish.</p>
<p>Then he sat in his hammock, munching on a
yam, without retort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bill finally, exasperated out of
all patience, &ldquo;we will pay well to have men and
boys take torches and scour the jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; demanded Jack, also in
Spanish and dialect.</p>
<p>The chief put down his yam and stared
without expression.</p>
<p>Finally he spoke, coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you much doctor-magic man!&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;All right. You make magic. You
find!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">TRAILED BY A JAGUAR</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Cliff,&rdquo; whispered Nicky, directing his
comrade&rsquo;s attention toward a limb not far
above their campfire. &ldquo;See those two bright
spots? Are they a jaguar&rsquo;s eyes, do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cliff moved his head upward very gently.
Tom, likewise, stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t anybody move,&rdquo; Tom whispered.
&ldquo;From where I am it looks too flat to be a cat.
But it&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tropical jungle was beginning to show
its eyes: would it go further and show its teeth
and claws? After three hours of darkness,
with only the blazing fire for protection, the
three chums were beginning to be a trifle nervous,
and the eyes above them, discovered by
Nicky, did not add to their ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Tom breathed, barely audibly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot hastily, Cliff. Ease your rifle up
till you can get a sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to make the first shot count!&rdquo; begged
Nicky softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; Cliff said; but his hands were trembling
so much that he fumbled with the rifle and
it clattered to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I&mdash;my muscles shake so!&rdquo; Cliff
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a coward, but the first shot is
so important&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; Nicky breathed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re closest. Can
you reach the gun and steady yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom, rather shakily, answered. &ldquo;Cliff can.
Just wait, Cliff. He won&rsquo;t jump straight down
into the fire. He&rsquo;ll wait till one of us goes off
as far as the wood pile. There&rsquo;s time to get
steady. Wait a minute, Cliff, till you get set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem able to make my muscles stop
quivering,&rdquo; Cliff replied, as low as he could.
&ldquo;Here, Tom, you take the rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom extended a hand very slowly toward the
weapon; Cliff pushed it slowly toward him. In
spite of their inward fear they realized that the
bright, tiny disks reflecting the firelight were
noting every move; they forced themselves to
be deliberate, lest a sudden move, startling that
dusky figure above, might cause the animal&mdash;or
whatever it was&mdash;to leap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>The rifle in his hand, Tom made a determined
effort to hold his muscles steady. He did not
think of his nerves as being unstrung, for he
had been told often by Mr. Gray that nerves
are only the messengers that take the messages
from the mind to the muscles: when the mind
sent the wrong messages or was unable to be
steady, the muscles were shaken, but not the
nerves.</p>
<p>He drew the rifle slowly to him, got his hand
onto its stock, lifted it with a deliberate determination
not to let the barrel waver.</p>
<p>Using every atom of his will-power to compel
his mind to concentrate on what he was going
to accomplish, instead of looking at his pictures
of what might happen, he managed to gain control
of himself.</p>
<p>Then he raised the barrel until its forward
sight and its rear sight grew a fine line to the
eyes so steadily glowing above, and a trifle to
one side of their fire. Cliff, shaking with his
disturbed mental condition, and Nicky, anxious
and worried, fixed their eyes on those so high
up above them and waited, tensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crack!&rdquo; the rifle barked, a spurt of flame
leaped from its barrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump!&rdquo; cried Tom, leaping away from the
fire.</p>
<p>Cliff and Nicky threw themselves away from
the fire, for there was a sliding, crackling,
scraping sound above the fire, and down came a
long, slender, weird looking form, to crash upon
the ground just beside the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good grief!&rdquo; cried Nicky. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a wildcat&mdash;what
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lizard&mdash;a big lizard!&rdquo; answered Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what they call an iguana&mdash;a huge lizard,&rdquo;
Cliff said. They approached the long reptile,
which was about three feet from nose to
tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I startled it&mdash;maybe I hit it,&rdquo; Tom
gasped. &ldquo;Anyhow, the fall has stunned it, I
think.&rdquo; He made sure by using the butt of the
rifle as a club and striking the backbone just
back of the skull: the lizard quivered, flailed its
tail several times and then relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, it wasn&rsquo;t a jaguar, I&rsquo;m thankful
to say!&rdquo; Cliff commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much better than a jaguar, for these
lizards are good to eat,&rdquo; Tom responded.
&ldquo;Goodness knows we could all eat. How about
cutting out some of the meat and roasting it on
sticks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did so, and as soon as they had cut
away what seemed to be the most promising
parts of the flesh, Tom had another idea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just take what we can eat,&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better drag the rest out to the far
edge of the glade and leave it. If any meat-eating
animals are around we&rsquo;d rather have
them get it and go away than to invite them to
risk a rush to grab it close to our fire&mdash;they
might grab us on the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly they took the carcass as far
away as they dared, Cliff, now recovered from
his attack of fear, watching with the rifle ready.</p>
<p>No beast approached while they worked, but
they had hardly returned to put their choicer
meat on spits made of twigs to roast it before
the fierce blaze of their fire when they heard
the unmistakable, blood-chilling wail of a
jungle cat, not far away. From here, and then
from there, first to the right, then to the left,
but ever closer, the intermittent wail continued.
Then, in the dull glow from their fire they saw
fiery eyes at the edge of the glade. There was
a rush, a swift retreat&mdash;and the remains of the
iguana had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see it?&rdquo; Nicky gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jaguar, for sure!&rdquo; Tom replied shakily.
&ldquo;Mr. Jaguar, take your supper and don&rsquo;t
bother us any more. And, fellows, let&rsquo;s hurry
up and finish our own eating so we won&rsquo;t tempt
any of his cousins and brothers to come any
closer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>They gave the meat only time to cook, and
then wasted no moments in tasting: the flesh
proved to be quite palatable and it was consumed
with the hearty avidity of appetites denied
since noon. What they had left they flung
far into the darkness: sudden, rushing sounds,
several shrill squeals and one yelp very much
like that of a startled dog, gave them the assurance
that the jungle denizens were on hand.</p>
<p>The chums changed their plans about watching,
two remaining awake and alert while one
slept. Not that much sleep came to any of
them.</p>
<p>From time to time, sometimes close, sometimes
afar, they heard the weird, child-like cry
of a jungle cat; the &ldquo;teesh-teesh&rdquo; of some other
animal, a peccary, perhaps, and, once, the slithering
progress of a large snake, apprised them
that the jungle life was close around them.</p>
<p>But the bright fire served to restrain jungle
curiosity and to hold the more fierce animals at
bay, although during the night they saw eyes
that glinted green, with a demon-like anger
smouldering in them, and knew that the meat-eaters
were abroad and watching their chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, I&rsquo;m glad daylight&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; yawned
Nicky when the dim green tracery overhead
began to let in the light which showed that the
sun was getting higher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea, fellows.
If I could &lsquo;shin up&rsquo; that branchy tree
yonder, and get to the top, I could see which is
East and which is West, and we could judge
which way to head for the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>Warning him about snakes and ants and
poisonous insects he might meet and must avoid
during his climb, Cliff and Tom agreed to his
plan.</p>
<p>When, after an arduous climb, during which
he disappeared from their sight in the heavy
foliage, Nicky&rsquo;s legs appeared again and finally
he slid carefully to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought you some breakfast,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;eggs! If we can roast them in the coals they
ought to be good. I know they are birds&rsquo; eggs
and not poisonous&mdash;I took them out of a big
nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That saves us having to shoot for our breakfast,&rdquo;
Tom said. &ldquo;Now which way is East?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That way!&rdquo; Nicky pointed down the trail at
the closer end of the glade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the sea is in that direction,&rdquo; Tom decided.
&ldquo;The river must be at our right hand
when we face the East, and we can&rsquo;t get lost
if we are careful not to get turned around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we avoid that?&rdquo; asked Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose you were to stand with your
arm extended toward the East&mdash;that trail and
the big tree. Then I&rsquo;d go just as far as I could
and still see you plainly, and set myself exactly
in the same position. Then Cliff would go on
beyond me and get himself set, picking some
marker to keep all three of us in a straight
line. When Cliff gets set you, Nicky, can go on
beyond him, then I go beyond you again, and
so we&rsquo;d be sure we still had our East direction
right and were moving South, and so toward
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought not to be very far,&rdquo; conceded Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all swamp on the South side of this
glade,&rdquo; objected Nicky. &ldquo;I looked, and we can&rsquo;t
get over it, and we daren&rsquo;t wade it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we could go on East, down the trail,
parallel with the river,&rdquo; Tom suggested. &ldquo;Only,
when we tried, last night, it ended &lsquo;blind&rsquo; and
so I guess we would waste time going that way.
Maybe we had better go West, that is, up the
trail. There must be some place where it will
take us to the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did we ever get into this glade from
the North, when we must have been South of
it and of the swamp when we came into the
jungle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we wandered in a sort of wide circle,&rdquo;
Cliff explained.</p>
<p>They ate the eggs, hot: they were not as
palatable as had been the iguana meat, but it
helped to stay their hunger. They were thirsty,
and began looking for water to drink as soon
as they set out on the upper trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>They found a spring, in a little clearing, and
since birds were bathing in the water Tom decided
that it was safe for them to drink from
it. They slaked their thirst and went on with
a much better confidence. The jungle had
yielded its food and drink to their confidence
in themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to think I&rsquo;m a &rsquo;fraid-cat,&rdquo;
Nicky said presently. &ldquo;Do you fellows notice
little cracklings off in the brush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard them, several times,&rdquo; Tom
agreed. &ldquo;I wondered if some Indian might
have seen our fire and was watching, going
along some other trail, to see where we are
bound for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s first on one side, then on the other,&rdquo;
Nicky protested. &ldquo;Once I heard something,
sort of &lsquo;whoosh!&rsquo; away up ahead, and now&mdash;listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drew closer together on the trail, and
Cliff took a tighter clutch of the rifle he carried.
They kept still, and presently, from a point
quite close, there came the crackle of a twig.</p>
<p>In an instant Cliff whirled to face the point,
the rifle leveled.</p>
<p>But then, from far ahead, there came a queer
noise as if something were breaking through
brush. The sound close at hand became also
more pronounced, like the passage of a body
through lush grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two of&mdash;whatever it is!&rdquo; whispered
Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Spellbound they watched the scene that developed
with the swiftness of a moving picture.</p>
<p>Into the path quite close to them, but ahead
of their position, a dark, almost naked Indian
sprang: he carried a bow and a quiver of arrows;
his ragged trousers were torn and
scratched. He glanced toward the chums only
for an instant. Then, backing toward them, he
pointed up the trail, saying no word.</p>
<p>Out from the brush, with a light bound, there
came a dark shape, lithe and crouched as it
landed, then swiftly assuming a posture that
made it look like a great, blackish cat, squatting
on its haunches, its long tail lashing to and fro,
switching the grass at either side.</p>
<p>Although few have seen the &ldquo;black panther,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;black jaguar&rdquo; of the Central Americas, and
some deny its existence, the chums, backed by
the authority of many books they had read,
recognized the true nature of the animal. It
was a black panther, or a dark specimen of the
jaguar species. Which it was did not matter.
That it was there, on the path before them, did
matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>The animal remained quiet, except for its
swishing tail. The Indian, eyes fixed on the
beast, slowly, gradually crept backward to be
closer to them. Evidently he knew nothing of
the use of the rifle that Cliff held ready. He
paid no heed to it, but carefully selected an
arrow, and very deliberately fitted it to his huge
bowstring. Slowly he sighted, drew the string
taut, and loosed the missile.</p>
<p>With a snarling cry the huge cat leaped into
the air, coming down on all-fours. Swiftly, almost
anxiously, the Indian drew out another
arrow&mdash;his first had only pierced the outer coat
of the beast.</p>
<p>Before he could draw his string, the jaguar&mdash;or
panther&mdash;leaped!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">WHERE NO WHITE MEN GO</span></h2>
<p>While the panther was still in midspring, the
Indian flung his body sidewise to escape the
leap. He struck against the rifle barrel, and
the impact knocked the weapon out of Cliff&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<p>Tom, quick as a cat himself, caught the rifle
before it touched the ground: the panther&rsquo;s leap
had fallen short by several feet and with its
eyes smouldering with hate, its red tongue playing
about its snarling lips, teeth bared, it gathered
swiftly for a second leap.</p>
<p>Nicky jumped to one side as the Indian threw
himself away: but Tom, swiftly bringing the
rifle to his shoulder, said to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now be steady. This shot must save our
lives.&rdquo; And he said a quick, earnest little
prayer in his mind.</p>
<p>The trigger tensed: the cartridge exploded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>Crouched with muscles like steel springs, the
panther never launched his body into the air.
The bullet struck his eye and thence penetrated
his skull. He rolled over, threshing his great
paws, snarling and biting at his own flesh in his
impotent helplessness.</p>
<p>Swiftly the Indian recovered himself, and, selecting
an arrow from his quiver he watched
his chance and managed to get to a point where,
in an instant of comparative quiet, he drove the
arrow like a lance, burying its point deep in the
animal&rsquo;s throat. There was renewed turmoil
in that jungle path, but it was short. The
jaguar, or panther, according to the natural
history you choose to believe about the black
species of Central America, lay still.</p>
<p>The Indian turned from watching the beast
and regarded the youths with stolid, but awakened
interest. His manner was not hostile. He
seemed to be wondering what course to take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he saw our fire last night and has
been watching us ever since,&rdquo; Nicky said, his
first remark since the exciting adventure, for
Nicky, without a weapon, felt just a trifle
ashamed because he had thought of his own
safety first and had leaped aside to let Tom try
to recover the rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way we saved his life,&rdquo; Cliff said. &ldquo;Or&mdash;Tom
did. He ought to be grateful. Let&rsquo;s
try him with what Spanish we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Indian did not respond either to
English or to Spanish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>He said no word but turning he beckoned to
them to follow him&mdash;they sidled past the beast,
giving it as wide a berth as possible in case it
still retained life enough to thresh out with
those claws, curved like scimitars, sharp as steel
grapples. The Indian led them up the trail for
a short distance and then turned off with the
trio following.</p>
<p>After an hour on the narrower, almost impenetrable
way, where sharp branches caught
at them, and poisonous scorpions stood their
ground and dared intrusion with their stings
all ready to back up their dare, Tom and his
comrades saw that they had been brought to a
small jungle village.</p>
<p>Slatternly, stout, worn old women, and sickly
looking younger girls, cleanly athletic young
fellows and old men came out to stare and to
listen to the very few words with which the
Indian explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are as sickly looking as the ones at
Porto Bello were,&rdquo; Cliff confided to his companions.
&ldquo;They certainly need a doctor,&rdquo; Tom
admitted. &ldquo;It seems as though all the Central
American Indians we have seen are degraded
and poor looking through carelessness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bad diet, too,&rdquo; Tom declared. &ldquo;They eat
the same diet year in and year out, and they&rsquo;re
too lazy&mdash;or don&rsquo;t know how&mdash;to exercise. I
don&rsquo;t know that we ought to pity them. Still,
somehow I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t we pity them?&rdquo; demanded
Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they really belong to a race which
had a civilization that seems to have been as
fine as ours in many ways,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;But
the race didn&rsquo;t keep up to its old standards and
so these people have themselves, and their ancestors,
to blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Nicky agreed.</p>
<p>They were not treated badly: their guide
showed them a hut where several women
brought them a sort of stew, taken from a big
pot at one part of the small cleared square of
the village. The stew was not as palatable as
some might like; but it was food and seemed
to be made in a reasonably clean way, considering
the scanty provisions for cleanliness that
these people possessed.</p>
<p>In that village Tom and his two comrades had
to remain for three days. No restraint was
put on their movements. The jungle was
enough to keep them prisoners. From the village,
once they had lost their sense of the direction
whence they had come, there was no trace
of the way out. Nevertheless people came and
went, going into the jungle in the morning and
returning with trapped game or birds shot with
their finely polished, long, light arrows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Nicky, who was rather good at archery, one
day made friends with one of the younger boys
who was watching a half dozen women polish
and bind pointed thorns onto sticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a nice, true one,&rdquo; said Nicky, knowing
that his words were not understood, but
intending to use the arrow to demonstrate his
own skill and impress the other youth favorably;
but the Indian, catching his hand, held
him back from the tiny pile on which the arrow
lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, why did he do that?&rdquo; Nicky wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they are touchy about their own
property!&rdquo; Tom decided.</p>
<p>However the youth proposed to show why
he had been so quick: he touched Nicky&rsquo;s arm
and the trio followed him to a spot not far
away, at the edge of the jungle. Here were
several large earthen urns or shallow pots.
Each had a lid.</p>
<p>The boy called and a companion issued from
the brush: there was a brief pantomimic exchange
between them and the latest arrival
turned back into the woods to come forth again
with a cage-like enclosure made of braided
heavy vine stems, stiff enough to retain its
shape. Within it, hissing and striking, was a
furious snake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rattler,&rdquo; confided Cliff. &ldquo;See its
tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s angry, too&mdash;I hope he isn&rsquo;t going
to release it!&rdquo; said Tom. Evidently the youth
had another purpose.</p>
<p>He took a forked stick and taking the lid off
one of the jars, he reached into its depths,
which were very unpleasantly odorous, and
brought out on the stick a piece of meat. It was
in a very bad state of decay already; however
the youth, lifting a small slat opening in the top
of the withe cage, lowered the stick with the
meat on it: then he did all in his power to infuriate
the snake by prodding at it with the
meat on the stick.</p>
<p>In a snake&rsquo;s rage the rattler struck and
struck repeatedly at the meat. Each time, as
the boys could see, more of his poison was left
in the meat. After a moment the boy took out
the stick and returned the meat to the jar, covering
it. The snake was killed, the Indians&rsquo;
signs indicating that his usefulness was ended.
But the white youths could see another cage in
the brush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Nicky said. &ldquo;They let the snake
strike till the old meat is full of poison and then
they leave it in these jars for awhile till the
poison gets all through the meat and it gets
pretty terrible. But then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw very quickly. The youth brought
some of the arrows and dipped the thorn points,
repeatedly, then set them aside to dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t want you to shoot with a poisoned
arrow,&rdquo; Tom explained. &ldquo;The least nick in your
skin with one of them might end in fearful
agony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Nicky soberly, and
nodded with a smile of real gratitude to his
Indian friend. The youth nodded briefly and
walked away. The tribe was pleasant and fed
the youths plentifully with such food as they
had, all cooked in the one big pot, and renewed
by dropping in whatever the day&rsquo;s hunting
brought home. But friendliness was absent.</p>
<p>Nicky wondered why they were kept there,
and finally he learned.</p>
<p>The guide who had brought them to the village
came to their hut with another, a taller,
very old and very stern looking fellow. He
made signs to Tom, pointing to his pocket and
then toward the small fire in a little ovenlike
place in a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what he&rsquo;s trying to tell you?&rdquo; Cliff
said. &ldquo;He wants you to show that lighter of
Bill&rsquo;s. He must have seen us use it in the
woods, when we lit the fire the first night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>That, clearly, was what he wanted for when
Tom drew out the lighter and made it work, the
old Indian looked on with amazement. Tom
made a half gesture to hand it to him but he
drew back and Cliff whispered hurriedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them get your &lsquo;magic&rsquo;&mdash;that must
be what they think it is. Keep it in your pocket
and use it as seldom as you can. The gasoline
may be dried out or the flint worn, and then it
won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. I&rsquo;ll save it all I can.&rdquo; Tom
agreed and put back the small mechanical apparatus
with which man has improved on the
old custom of making fire by use of flint and
steel: now the steel is a wheel and by whisking
it sharply against a prepared bit of flint, a
spark is made to fall on a wick soaked with
gasoline, which ignites.</p>
<p>Soon after the lighter was demonstrated, the
Indians beckoned to the youths, and by signs
bade them follow. Half a dozen young men
had packs slung on their backs. Led by the
aged Indian, and with the three white youths
in the line, they started off into a different
jungle trail that wound upward steadily, and
got more difficult and hotter and more unpleasant
every hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose they are taking us?&rdquo;
Nicky wondered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Tom caught up to their guide and in pantomime
tried to make him see that they wanted
to know where they were going. He pointed
forward, then to himself, then to the trail, and
then forward again. The man seemed to understand.</p>
<p>With a great sweep of his arm he described
a circle in the air. Then the same circle was
made but pointing toward the ground, part of
the imaginary line being drawn across the trail.</p>
<p>Then he pointed forward and nodded: he
pointed backward and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember what my father said
about the charmed circle&mdash;the circle the
Chucunaque Indians have established?&rdquo; Cliff
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tom agreed. &ldquo;Where few white men
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; Nicky added. &ldquo;According
to the gestures of our brother, who ought to be
initiated into the Mystery Boys order and
taught some signs that can be understood&mdash;according
to him, the way leads in but the way
doesn&rsquo;t lead out again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">IN THE CLOSED CIRCLE</span></h2>
<p>Three days were spent on that trail: at times
the chums felt as though the humid, close air
would overcome them, the exertion would overwhelm
their endurance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless they kept on stubbornly. The
Indians seemed not to mind any amount of exertion,
and it was agreed by the white comrades
that they would not show themselves
weaker. Truly they were not trained to such a
life, yet they were determined to stand up&mdash;and
they did. Grit carried them along when weary
muscles rebelled.</p>
<p>At last they came into a cleared spot in the
foothills. In it was a sizeable village, the capital
city, as one might say, of the tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be mighty grateful for a hut and a long
rest,&rdquo; Nicky panted, walking resolutely, with
shoulders back, into the clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo; agreed Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here too,&rdquo; Cliff echoed the sentiment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>They were led across the cleared space.
Around it, without any particular order, huts
were erected. They were built of an open fashion,
with stakes at the corners, and at intervals,
to support the roofs of thatch, woven together
quite tightly and sloped to shed water.</p>
<p>Toward one of these the chums were ushered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see what I see?&rdquo; whispered Cliff,
his observant eyes taking in a squatted figure
in the shade of a hut across the quadrangle.</p>
<p>His friends looked that way. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a white
man,&rdquo; Nicky admitted. &ldquo;But what makes you
so excited about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cliff, &ldquo;we know that Henry and
that Mort Beecher got started ahead of us. I
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the instant that he paused the white man
looked up. He turned his head and called to
another figure resting in a hammock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Henry!&rdquo; he cried, in a fat, hoarse
voice. &ldquo;Wake up. Seems like we got visitors,
seems like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up and the chums saw a portly, very
short body on two brief pillars of legs, with a
round, bullet head, twinkling eyes and a smiling
mouth, over which an extremely red nose spoke
of the many nights he had spent with Jack in
Porto Bello, for there was no doubt that the
man was Mort Beecher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>While the chums paused, astonished to a degree,
and hardly knowing what action to take,
with this sudden discovery, Henry Morgan
rolled out of the hammock and came to the side
of the hut. He screened his sleepy eyes from
the sun and then uttered a word under his
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Morgan, and no mistake!&rdquo; Nicky exclaimed.
In sudden anger, recalling the trick
that had been played on them, he started forward;
but Tom restrained him with a hand on
his arm. Nicky stopped, and after an instant
to collect himself he felt that Tom&rsquo;s decision
for silence was wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live and breathe!&rdquo; cried Henry Morgan.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d ever expect to see you lads here?
Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, yourself!&rdquo; answered Tom, advancing.
He met the outstretched hand. He grasped its
perspiring breadth and gave it a good grip.</p>
<p>Tom saw at once that Henry Morgan, after
his first surprise, had decided on some course
of action: Tom proposed to hold himself alert,
but not to show anger or aversion until he
learned the other fellow&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did you ever get here?&rdquo;
demanded Henry. &ldquo;Here&mdash;meet the man I used
to talk about so much&mdash;Mort Beecher. A finer
pal never lived. Shake, Mort. Shake hands
with Tom, and Nicky, and Cliff. Now, we&rsquo;re
all pals together! But how did you get here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians brought us, as you saw, just
now,&rdquo; Tom answered. &ldquo;How did you get here so
much ahead of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put a good deal of meaning into his look
and Henry looked away for a moment: then he
faced them again, grinning and speaking in the
husky voice they remembered all too well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I left you and Bill&mdash;but the other lads
have told you how I came down the river from
the village&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tom responded, &ldquo;and they told us
what you said&mdash;that we were sick and couldn&rsquo;t
get away and there was no use for them to try
to follow us or to rescue us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did tell them that. Yes, I did,&rdquo; Henry
said, affably. Nicky thought, &ldquo;what a villain
he is!&rdquo; but he kept still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told them that. &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause I
was anxious to get them to help me find Mort
Beecher and not to waste any time. That was
good sense. &rsquo;Cause why? There wasn&rsquo;t any
time to be lost. If Toosa knew anything about
the Golden Sun&mdash;and that was the little girl you
was looking for!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it a mine, instead?&rdquo; interrupted
Nicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mine nothing! Where did you get that fol-de-rol?
No. &rsquo;Twas the little girl, and if what
he said was right&mdash;that the man I wanted was
in Porto Bello&mdash;the cruiser could go and find
him and hurry down and rescue the girl without
wasting time to wait. I knew Toosa would
see that you got out all right. I had told him
to. I had given him money to look out for
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, thought the chums, Henry Morgan
did that sort of thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, when you boys wouldn&rsquo;t come on,
what was I to do? I knew there was no time to
waste. &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause Mort might be
took out of Porto Bello and not ever be found
again&mdash;or not for a good while. And there was
a innocent little golden-haired girl and her life
at stake amongst the Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face was so earnest and his tones were
so sincere that if they had not seen his duplicity
already the chums might have believed him.
But, with all he had done, they simply stood
still and listened.</p>
<p>Henry, however&mdash;and Mort, too&mdash;seemed to
think that the story was very convincing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;And good it was that he didn&rsquo;t waste a minute,&rdquo;
Mort broke in. &ldquo;He has your interests
at heart, has Henry. Seems like no fellow ever
was as fine as Henry, seems like. You can kick
me for a football if that ain&rsquo;t so. He knew I
was likely to be took from Porto Bello, so he
hurried there with a sloop and got me and we
hurried here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause we knowed the little
girl&rsquo;s life was in danger. So we got it fixed up
that we was doctors, so we could get into the
country. That&rsquo;s so that the Indians would
trust us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nicky. &ldquo;And of course you told
the San Blas Indians&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw Tom touching his ear, in a Mystery
Boys sign of warning, and he changed the statement.
&ldquo;You told the San Blas Indians the same
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo; Henry grinned at them. &ldquo;And I told
them more, as you may have heard. I told them
that when our friends came along, to pass them
right along and help them to follow us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky could not contain his disgust any
longer. All this was a tissue of falsehood and
he hated such talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told them that they must forbid us to
stay near them&mdash;said we were evil doctors and
if we came we would do harm. And what&rsquo;s
more, you said that if the people you doctored
didn&rsquo;t get well, it was because we were working
harm on them!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky stopped for breath and Henry, after a
little start, turned to Mort Beecher and held
out his hands, palms up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that Indians for you?&rdquo; he pleaded for
agreement. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that Indians? They&rsquo;ll twist
and alter anything you say. &rsquo;Cause why?
&rsquo;Cause they want to keep everybody out of this
country. They don&rsquo;t want the dear little
golden-haired girl rescued. Not they. They
want her to stay here and be a priestess and
cure them and dance in their festivals and bring
them good luck. And we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we want to save her&mdash;and here we are,
risking life and limb and trying to help, and
you go and get mad.&rdquo; Mort Beecher drew his
fat jowls into a somber, dejected appearance.
&ldquo;Seems like there ain&rsquo;t any gratitude in the
world, seems like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right&mdash;the Indians might have mixed
up and twisted what you said,&rdquo; Tom agreed.
&ldquo;Nicky isn&rsquo;t really mad at you&mdash;he only felt
that you ought to have brought us all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for what?&rdquo; demanded Mort Beecher.
&ldquo;For all of you to be killed? Wasn&rsquo;t it bad
enough for us to be done that to? Wasn&rsquo;t two
lives enough to risk&mdash;but where is the rest of
your party?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Then Cliff did demand silence. He fell back
into an easy position with one leg made shorter
than the other, as though he were &ldquo;at ease,&rdquo;
and clasped both hands hanging loosely before
him. That was the Mystery Boys&rsquo; signal, &ldquo;Do
not speak!&rdquo; Nicky saw it and Tom nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered Cliff, with assumed lack of
interest, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re where they can do more good
than here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so. Seems like I never hoped anything
so much, seems like,&rdquo; Mort declared.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause why?&rdquo; Henry declaimed. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause
we&rsquo;re in the sacred circle of the Chucunaque
Indians&mdash;and who-so gets in may never get out.
And yet we do all that for you. Now, tell us
how you got here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians brought us, I tell you,&rdquo; Tom
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, for why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see their chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s something. It&rsquo;s more than we
are able to do.&rdquo; Henry turned to Mort for
sanction and Mort nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like he won&rsquo;t see us, seems like,&rdquo; he
acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anything of my sister&mdash;had
any clues?&rdquo; demanded Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor can&rsquo;t get any,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause
the chief won&rsquo;t see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand his language, what
little he uses,&rdquo; Mort added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;And neither will you!&rdquo; Henry stated flatly.</p>
<p>The Indian who was conducting them beckoned
curtly. &ldquo;Well, we haven&rsquo;t gotten anywhere,&rdquo;
Mort said. &ldquo;So, go ahead to your hut
and rest. We can talk later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian conducted the chums to another
hut. At the time they wondered why the five
white people were not put together. However,
the reason was soon to be discovered.</p>
<p>They made the best of things. Their movements
were not restricted any more than in the
smaller village. The same sort of general food-pots
were in evidence, into which everything
that was to be cooked was dropped, the resulting
stew being dished out with calabashes as it
was required.</p>
<p>There were a number of Albinos, or light-faced,
light-haired, pale-eyed people, among the
Indians, and no one seemed to have much use
for them. They kept a good deal to themselves.</p>
<p>Hammocks were provided for sleeping and
rest, and several women brought food at intervals.
For the balance of that day the chums
were left alone. But when they tried to go over
to talk further with Henry and later, when
Mort came to see them, Indians firmly intervened
and refused to let the two parties communicate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now why is that, do you suppose?&rdquo; Cliff
asked.</p>
<p>But his chums could not furnish a reason.</p>
<p>That night, well after dark, great activity
was to be observed in the village; mostly it centered
about the chief&rsquo;s large hut, a sort of place
of assembly for the people. Heavy skins were
hung around part of it and, from where their
hut was situated, the chums could not see what
was going on; but people were running about
with torches, and some were carrying bundles
of torch material into the enclosure.</p>
<p>Finally an Indian, carrying a torch, appeared
and beckoned for the boys to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re in for something,&rdquo; Nicky observed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it. I get tired of waiting.
Action for mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They approached the large hut.</p>
<p>Suddenly Tom stopped as though shot, and
gripped Nicky&rsquo;s arm with a pressure that made
the other wince.</p>
<p>Cliff, also, stopped as though an electric
shock made him jump.</p>
<p>High and clear, from the hut, came a shrill
voice, crying, in English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, then! I&rsquo;ll be so glad to hear
somebody talk English I won&rsquo;t know what to
do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">MAGIC AGAINST MAGIC</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Go slow!&rdquo; Cliff urged, detaining Tom before
the latter could make an impetuous rush
toward the large hut. &ldquo;If your sister is in
there, be sure you won&rsquo;t spoil everything by
telling her&mdash;before you do tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom loitered. For once Nicky saw eye to
eye with Cliff, and realized that hasty action
might endanger them all. He added his plea to
Cliff&rsquo;s and Tom, finally, agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are in the Chucunaque
circle. We don&rsquo;t know what they may be planning
to do to us. We don&rsquo;t trust Henry or
Mort and we can&rsquo;t count on them. The main
thing is to rescue Margery, for I am sure she is
in that hut; but we can do more, maybe, by
going slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took up their pace again, following the
Indian. Just ahead of them Henry Morgan
and Mort Beecher were being led in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>When the chums entered the hut they saw
that an Indian somewhat more powerful and
stalwart than the others, for the Chucunaque&rsquo;s
were not a large type, sat in a hammock in the
center of the hut. Close to him, squatting on
the ground, were a dozen men, elderly, solemn,
dignified: the youths judged them to be councillors,
as they were. Off at one side sat two
other men, surrounded by the now familiar implements
of the doctors, or medicine men, who
both worked spells and tried, by their witcheries,
to cure disease: their small success was
attested by the prevalence of sickness and diseased
skins among their tribesmen.</p>
<p>But the point to which the youths&rsquo; eyes focused,
and on which every bit of their attention
concentrated was that where a girl sat&mdash;the
only female figure in the hut; she was fairly
tall, a little less than five feet and five inches,
they guessed as she sat. Her clothing was of
the same sort as that of the Indian women outside;
a ragged, but clean waist of European or
American style was the only feature of difference,
and that was so faded and worn that it
hardly looked like anything. Beside that a
short petticoat of dull colored cloth completed
the visible clothing: her head was bare, and so
were her brown, dusky limbs, and her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>But she was an American, not an Indian!
And the crown of long, bright golden hair, glittering
and glistening in the wavering torch-light
was all the proof that the three comrades
needed to identify her.</p>
<p>Tom could hardly repress a cry. He held his
lips tight shut. Nicky, clutching his arm, felt
the muscles stiffen, and gave his biceps a reassuring,
excited squeeze. Cliff, noting everything,
saw that Tom had regained his control
and would be careful not to do anything that
could endanger their plans.</p>
<p>Tom saw Henry and Mort draw closer together
and whisper: they, too, realized who the
girl was, in spite of her dark skin and her expressionless
face. She had been long enough
among the impassive Indians to acquire their
facial stillness. When she spoke, her voice was
high and excited, like that of a girl of ten, and
she talked in the same way that a child would,
using simple words, instead of using the manners
and conversation of a miss of sixteen.
When the Indians took her, Tom mused, she
stopped growing up with no one to talk to in
her native language.</p>
<p>Henry and Mort, still whispering, were led
to a point to the right of the hammock, a little
in front of the medicine men. Tom, Cliff and
Nicky were stationed at the other side, before
the councillors. It was easy to see that they
were considered as separate and not friendly,
for some reason.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>The girl could hardly wait until the ceremony
of placing the white people was finished: then
she said, eagerly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, white men&mdash;and you, too, boys. I
didn&rsquo;t know you were here. My! It&rsquo;s good to
see so many people. I&rsquo;m tired of Indians. They
brought me from another village. I have to
listen to you and tell them what you say. Then
I will tell you what they say. How did you
come here? Will you take me away? Don&rsquo;t
tell them. Don&rsquo;t let them know. But will you
take me away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; cried Tom, forgetting himself for
an instant: then he became silent again. But
the girl, without changing her expression,
nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know boys
could get in here&mdash;or men either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not boys,&rdquo; challenged Nicky. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
young fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently the chief was impatient, for he
could not understand what was being said. He
spoke gruffly, one word. The girl turned and
made some gestures, also speaking several
strange words. Then she turned back toward
Tom, and from then on she seemed, for some
odd reason, to ignore Henry and Mort, almost&mdash;her
whole mind seemed to be centered on Tom,
and she studied him and appeared to be wondering
about him and he, in turn, could not take
his eyes off her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;The chief doesn&rsquo;t like us to talk,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad you came. Will you
take me away? Honest&mdash;cross-your-heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom made the gesture, Nicky and Cliff following
suit. Henry and Mort bent glowering
looks on them and shook their heads at them
vigorously.</p>
<p>For once, forgetting his manners, Nicky
grinned back impudently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;The chief thinks the
older men are big doctors and he thinks you
boys&mdash;young fellows!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and she laughed at
them and clapped her hands like a teasing child
of ten, &ldquo;are bad doctors. He is going to make
you show him which is strongest&mdash;magic, you
know. So if you b&mdash;young men can do big
magic, don&rsquo;t waste any time. These Indians
are cruel. Don&rsquo;t joke with them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Tom nodded, keeping from his face the
qualms of unease that clutched at his heart.
What would the test be? How could they meet
it? When they were so close to recovering the
sister he loved, must strange customs interfere?
Nicky and Cliff were perturbed, too, but they
kept their faces as impassive as they could.
The Indians were not going to win! Cliff regretted
that he had left the rifle in the hut
across the clearing but he hoped they would
not need it. However, he made a secret plan
to get out and secure it if things began to look
black.</p>
<p>One of the councillors stood up and spoke
briefly: the girl listened and then turned to the
white parties and translated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say word has come to them that great
doctors wished to come into their country to
heal their people,&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could word come&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t any
newspaper or telegraph or telephone,&rdquo; cried
Nicky, incredulously. The girl merely nodded
toward the medicine men as though they had
secured the message in some way, and continued
her translation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say they wish to see the great doctors
heal their tribe and so they let them come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned again to listen, and once more
she translated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that you bo&mdash;young men&mdash;may be
evil doctors. They say the first doctors told
the San Blas Indians evil doctors would follow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Nicky glared at Henry and Henry
looked uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they await your answers,&rdquo; she said,
turning first to Henry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Henry gave out a string of pleading to establish
the fact that he and Mort were the good
doctors but that if their medicines had no
power it was because of some evil influence. He
did not quite dare to denounce the boys.
Margery, as Tom already called her in his
thoughts, did her duty in translating, and then
she turned toward Tom, and waited.</p>
<p>Tom glanced swiftly toward Nicky and Cliff.
He wanted to be sure they had no message to
guide him. They looked anxious and earnest,
but they had not thought out any answer. Tom,
bending his head on his hands, tried to think
what reply would show that they were not evil
doctors, for it would not help much to declare
it and stop: the Indians would ask proof, and
he could not think of any way to prove his
claim. The chief, his councillors and the medicine
men waited without movement. They were
used to tedious conferences. The girl watched
without expression.</p>
<p>Think as hard as he would, Tom could find
nothing to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are only three young fellows who got
lost in the jungle,&rdquo; he said, finally, a pleading
look in his face as he confronted the sister he
dared not name. &ldquo;The Indians brought us
here. We don&rsquo;t know why!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>She translated by gestures and a few words.
The chief looked at the councillors and they in
turn consulted the medicine men. Finally one
of the medicine men stood up and addressed
the chief. After he had finished the chief
spoke to the girl and she, in her turn, translated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first man says the doctors told the San
Blas Indians they healed by magic and the
chief wishes to see some of their magic. But
he says that the medicine men say the younger
ones are magic doctors too and he had them
brought here because one of them showed his
magic in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry stared toward the three chums and
then, putting back his head, he laughed: Mort,
in his puffy, chuckly voice, joined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good one!&rdquo; Henry said. &ldquo;Tell the
chief he can hit me for a punchin&rsquo; bag if they
know any magic. They&rsquo;re just kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery frowned but as the chief questioned
she had to translate. But it was easy to see
that her sympathy was with the younger
fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief says,&rdquo; she told them all finally,
&ldquo;he will see which one has magic, and if you
both have magic he will see whose magic is the
most powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Suddenly Tom elevated his hand to caress
his ear and Nicky and Cliff saw the sign and
folded their arms. It was a call for the Mystery
Boys&rsquo; council. Tom wanted to say something
he did not wish to have the other two
white men hear: he proposed to ask by their
signs and they were ready.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">A TIGHT CORNER</span></h2>
<p>In the silence that followed the final words
of the girl, the Mystery Boys signified their
readiness to enter a council. And as they folded
their arms they saw the girl stare at them
amazedly and then her face became intent, but
she did not look at them. Instead, she looked
up at the roof of the hut. Anyone would think
she was trying to remember something.</p>
<p>But Tom was not paying any attention to
her. He realized that he and his chums were
in a tight corner. The Indians were cruel and
callous: when they demanded magic, they expected
magic. Failure to produce it meant certain
doom, perhaps&mdash;and Tom shuddered!&mdash;with
one of those terrible arrows he had seen
the youth preparing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>And the chums knew nothing about magic!
They had seen stage people produce rabbits
from supposedly empty silk hats and make
coins disappear. Of course, with the proper
apparatus and lots of experience these things
could be done. Out in the jungle, among hostile
people, with no apparatus and no experience,
there was no hope!</p>
<p>So Tom planned to communicate to his chums
his idea of what they must do. There was little
time to spare. As yet the Indians were not
openly hostile. They were intent on seeing
something marvelous and while that was in
their minds&mdash;and until they were disappointed&mdash;they
would be quiet.</p>
<p>But, after that!&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Tom determined to help his sister and, if possible,
to enable his chums to escape. To accomplish
that without having Henry and Mort
interfere and perhaps warn the Indians&mdash;they
were capable of anything to secure Margery&rsquo;s
secret of the Golden Sun for themselves&mdash;Tom
made up his mind to make one desperate effort
to escape.</p>
<p>Tom concentrated every effort of his mind.
He had convened the Mystery Boys but he must
convey his message. He knew how he proposed
to do it, and in such a way that Henry and Mort
would not comprehend, while the chums would.
But it took some hard thinking to make up the
sentences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>As Cliff had done, back in Mexico, Tom proposed
to use the special code in which he would
say short sentences. The final word of each
sentence would have a meaning. Taken all together
the last words of all the sentences would
make a sentence themselves.</p>
<p>He had done this when he called the chums
to see what news Henry had. Now Tom must
give them a plan and do it briefly and so clearly
that they could not mistake his meaning.</p>
<p>Therefore he paid no attention to Margery
for the moment, but held his eyes on the floor,
making up and going over his plan.</p>
<p>While he did this the chief spoke and Margery
turned from her study of the roof and said
in English to Henry Morgan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief says you show your magic first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she studied the youths intently and appeared
to be trying to recall something. Her
eyes went to the roof again and as far as she
was concerned, Henry and his magic did not
exist.</p>
<p>Henry looked baffled for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;tell him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he cleared his husky
throat, &ldquo;&mdash;tell him we got to get our magic prepared.
It takes time. Ask him to let us wait
till tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not bother to translate. There
was a wicked little gleam of malice in her eyes,
and she simply said: &ldquo;Do your magic now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Henry consulted with Mort, while the medicine
men whispered together and one of them
chuckled hoarsely. Henry sent Mort away, evidently
to get some materials for his trick, whatever
it might be.</p>
<p>Then Tom divulged his plan.</p>
<p>First he picked up a small bit of loose dirt
from the hut floor, and with a slinging, underhand
motion he shied it to one side. That was
the signal which meant, &ldquo;I will say short sentences.
The last word of each one will have a
meaning and all together they will give a message.&rdquo;
If he had spoken his meaning could not
have been plainer to his comrades.</p>
<p>They concentrated their whole attention on
Tom.</p>
<p>Though they were too busy to notice, so did
Margery. There was a growing eagerness, a
sudden wondering expression, on her face.</p>
<p>Had they noted Margery&rsquo;s face as did the Indians,
they would have seen it light up suddenly
with a great amazement. That tiny bit of earth,
shied in that way, awakened the memories she
had been trying to recall.</p>
<p>She knew who that youth was, over across the
weirdly lighted Indian hut!</p>
<p>He was Tom&mdash;her brother!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>But she did not speak, nor did she cry out.
The Indians, watching her with their steady,
black eyes, saw the first show of surprise and
then she settled back into her position, and her
face became expressionless. She was a child in
her use of English because she had no one to
grow up with; but in her common sense she had
all the wise patience of the Indians. She waited
quietly. This was no time for a dramatic
reunion!</p>
<p>Tom, his sentences ready, spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you fellows notice the sun set? Wasn&rsquo;t
it like fire? I saw it over the hut. It was a
picture I&rsquo;d like to take. Who is this girl? Out
here in the jungle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a sign that he was finished, but then
went on speaking in a mutter, although his
friends no longer heeded him; it was done to
throw aside suspicion. His message had to be
recalled. What had he said.</p>
<p>Margery did not understand at all. She was
disappointed. When Tom used to shy a pebble
it meant that he wanted to fool his companions
of the moment and she and he would talk rapidly
in a fashion to confuse his schoolmates.
They had made that up together when they
played and went to school. And here he was out
in this wild place, come to her. Did he recognize
her? He had made one of their old signals.
But then he went on talking in a different code.
It did not seem right and she was puzzled. She
knew it was Tom. Did he know her?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Nicky and Cliff had by that time discovered
the endings of the sentences and knew Tom&rsquo;s
message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set fire (to) hut. Take Girl (into) Jungle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a more perfect form the message meant
that Tom would set fire to the hut with the cigar
lighter if he could and then they would all try
to escape in the confusion and panic and take
Margery into the jungle.</p>
<p>Cliff and Nicky nodded.</p>
<p>But, suddenly, all three were startled.</p>
<p>Margery stamped her foot!</p>
<p>All three stared. They recalled that she was
there and looked to see what caused her to
stamp. To their amazement she was standing
up, her arms folded.</p>
<p>Tom, staring, suddenly saw a great light.</p>
<p>He recalled that he and Margery had &ldquo;made
up&rdquo; secrets and that some of their old signs and
secrecies had been adopted by his chums when
the trio formed themselves into their secret
order.</p>
<p>But Margery was saying something! What
was it, again?</p>
<p>&ldquo;H. L. Listen! I know you, Tom. Keep still!
No time for that. But think, Tom! H. L. Tell
me. H. L.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H. L.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom saw it. He understood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>The signal of the pebble used to mean that
they would have secrets and she would say,
&ldquo;H. L.&rdquo; for Hog-Latin, the higgledy-piggledy,
rapid way so many school boys and girls talk.
She wanted him to tell her what he had told his
chums, and in &ldquo;Hog-Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-kitty will-ikky set-akk&mdash;set-totty fire-ikky
to-pitty hut-ikky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes-ippy I-bitty see-kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then-ippy run-itty quick-itty-fast-itty with-itty
you-ikky off-itty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They exchanged the passages of mixed words
and funny endings with such swiftness that
Cliff and Nicky, a little surprised and half forgetting
their old &ldquo;stunt,&rdquo; had difficulty in following
it; surely the other two men, not versed
in that kind of youthful foolishness, would not
understand any better than the Indians.</p>
<p>And so a childish custom that older people
thought silly was being turned to good account.</p>
<p>Without expression, shaking her head, Margery
said more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-kitty good-ibiddy,&rdquo; she clipped out. &ldquo;Get-ibbidy
lost-ibbidy in-akkity junge-y-gongle-y
bangle-y do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That conveyed their meaning clearly to the
two if to no others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>Tom had told his sister he proposed to fire
the hut and then to help her escape with them;
she had said it would not do because they would
be lost in the jungles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let me think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time the attention swung from this
strange scene, for the Indians saw Mort returning
with some apparatus which he set down gingerly
on the floor. Every eye was fixed on him.
Forgotten was the scene which had been enacted.
Only one, a medicine man, kept his
shrewd eyes fixed on Margery as though he
would try to see beneath her flesh and bone to
the working of her brain and mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had some magic&mdash;I thought the Indians
said so!&rdquo; she told Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Suddenly Tom recollected the lighter.
The woods Indian had probably brought news
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, and explained to his sister,
very briefly, that he could make what Indians
would consider a magic light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When your turn
comes&mdash;we will win!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">WHERE WITS COUNT!</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another reason, and a better one,
why we daren&rsquo;t try to fire the hut and escape
with Margery,&rdquo; said Nicky, jogging Tom&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;Look beyond the torchlight. Shade your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Cliff did so. At once they saw the
reason Nick meant.</p>
<p>Waiting just outside the hut at one end were
a dozen men armed with bows&mdash;and probably
with the deadly poisoned arrows.</p>
<p>At another point was another cluster of men,
whose arms were not in evidence; yet they
seemed to preserve orderly positions and to
be awaiting some signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good grief!&rdquo; Nicky said. &ldquo;We are in a tight
corner and no mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;But I think we will get
out all right. Margery doesn&rsquo;t seem to be worried.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world do you suppose Henry
Morgan got hold of a suitcase type moving picture
machine?&rdquo; asked Cliff, nodding toward the
apparatus that Henry and Mort were fussing
over on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; said Cliff, &ldquo;where did you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the sloop,&rdquo; Henry answered, fumbling
with the lamp, which was of the calcium carbide,
and water, type. He did not seem to know
much about it, although Mort, who knew less,
was fussing and puffing on his fat knees and
giving a multitude of instructions, none of
which seemed to help. &ldquo;We thought the Indians
would be puzzled about it,&rdquo; Henry added. &ldquo;We
borrowed it. Do you fellows know anything
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work your own magic!&rdquo; said Nicky, rather
maliciously. He could not resist the impulse
to dig back at Henry for all the meanness the
latter had shown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry for that!&rdquo; said Mort shortly.</p>
<p>Margery looked on with much mystification,
as did the Indians. When the chief questioned
his medicine men, evidently asking what sort of
magic this was to be, they seemed baffled.</p>
<p>Margery questioned Tom with her eyes but
he smiled across at her and while wondering,
in his mind, how he was going to make any
showing against such a manifestation, he did
not lose his courage or his trust in being led to
know what to do and how to do it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need water for that carbide,&rdquo; suggested
Cliff. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell you that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that&mdash;knew it all the time!&rdquo;
scoffed Mort. Turning to Margery he demanded.
&ldquo;Have water fetched!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that sort of thing a little,&rdquo; Cliff said.
&ldquo;Back in high school we had an outfit of that
kind. You see, it all packs in a suitcase to make
it portable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nicky agreed. &ldquo;The film is what they
call non-inflamable. It won&rsquo;t burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Cliff agreed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it
can be used with an open flame light. You
know, don&rsquo;t you, that the lamp has to be filled
with those crystals of calcium carbide&mdash;in the
can, there. Then, water is put in the container
and when it is all assembled and the screw is
opened, water drips onto the crystals and they
act to make gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nicky said. &ldquo;We had something about
that in chemistry class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mort and Henry were not having such a
good time setting the machine in position. They
got the &ldquo;head&rdquo; or apparatus for jerking the bits
of exposed film down, back end foremost, and
had to turn it around. That made them fidget
and sweat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>To a degree, even in face of the danger, the
boys were amused at the &ldquo;hot time,&rdquo; as Nicky
whispered, that the older men were having to
get their magic in readiness.</p>
<p>Evidently the chief sensed something of the
sort for he made several impatient exclamations
and his councillors stirred restlessly. But
he said nothing to Henry and Mort and, finally,
they seemed to have everything in readiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;Mort, light her up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mort, with a few matches in a flat paper
packet, struck the first and tried to light the
lamp. The effort was fruitless. Nervously he
struck match after match.</p>
<p>Tom, who sensed what was wrong, half
opened his lips, but Cliff shook his head and
Tom waited.</p>
<p>Mort turned to Henry and demanded more
matches. Curtly and bruskly Henry made an
exclamation and shoved Mort aside. Upset,
the fat one lost his balance and tumbled in a
heap. This brought a grunt of amusement from
the watching Indians and Mort reddened with
anger and dismay. Their plans were not working
out so well.</p>
<p>Henry struck his few matches and when failure
met his effort to ignite the lamp he sat back
with a look of mingled chagrin and fear on his
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re whipped,&rdquo; he grunted to Mort.
Mort mopped his wet brow and looked appealingly
at the boys.</p>
<p>The chief said something as Henry rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says &lsquo;your magic seems to fail!&rsquo;&rdquo; Margery
translated. &ldquo;Does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; said Henry, curtly, looking from side
to side.</p>
<p>The chief turned toward Tom and his chums.</p>
<p>Tom had a plan. It was based on something
that he knew and which Henry and Mort had
failed to recall if they, also, knew of it.</p>
<p>When the crystals of carbide are first exposed
to water, it takes a fair space of time
for the gas to be liberated in a quantity sufficient
to generate pressure enough to force it
through the burner tip.</p>
<p>That amount of time had elapsed, but in their
haste Henry and Mort had either failed to
open the setting screw or had not tightened the
base enough to hold the pressure. Tom proposed
to take advantage of this guess and to
turn the older men&rsquo;s magic to his own account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the chief,&rdquo; he said to Margery, &ldquo;the
magic of the great doctors has not answered
their call. Then ask them if they give up to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery spoke and gestured; then she turned
to Henry.</p>
<p>Morosely Henry and Mort nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;What else can we do?&rdquo; Mort grunted.
&ldquo;Seems like we can&rsquo;t work it, seems like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the chief this,&rdquo; Tom went on. &ldquo;We do
not work evil magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; cried Henry, suddenly, with a malicious
leer toward Tom. &ldquo;First you tell the chief
that our magic failed because them&mdash;them evil
ones work against us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery looked toward Tom. &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; he
agreed.</p>
<p>She did. The chief looked toward Tom and
scowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, though,&rdquo; Tom continued, not at all
frightened. &ldquo;Now tell the chief that these men
admit that our magic is stronger than theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery, smiling in spite of the gravity of
the occasion, spoke.</p>
<p>The chief nodded, and his next frown was
turned toward Henry, who looked a little desperate.
Then he said, softly, to Mort. &ldquo;But
them busybody kids can&rsquo;t do what we can&rsquo;t.
How can they light the lamp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mort nodded and perked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the chief,&rdquo; Tom added. &ldquo;Tell him that
our magic is good, and it is even stronger than
the other. And to prove it we will make their
own magic work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>When Margery had done this the chief looked
at the youths with some surprise and a little
mystification. His medicine men also nodded
and motioned toward the small, compact picture
machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;unroll that piece of cloth
they brought. And you and Cliff go to the side,
about ten feet off, and hold it up, as taut as you
can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were doing as he asked, Tom
bent down and examined the picture projecting
apparatus. It was not yet &ldquo;threaded up&rdquo; with
film, and he took from the small case one of
the three rolls of films, small, tightly rolled, in
little tin containers.</p>
<p>Opening a &ldquo;can&rdquo; he unrolled a bit of the end,
the blank &ldquo;trailer&rdquo; that is put between the rollers
and toothed gears so that when the machine
is started the picture begins properly.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t marked &lsquo;non-flam&rsquo;,&rdquo; he called to Cliff.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just marked with the regular kodak marking
in the edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then be careful,&rdquo; Cliff said. &ldquo;It will blaze
up, then. Watch what you do and don&rsquo;t hold
it still while it&rsquo;s in front of the flame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better come and work it,&rdquo; Tom
urged.</p>
<p>Margery ran lightly across to take Cliff&rsquo;s end
of the sheet. She and Nicky, tall enough to lift
it four or five feet up, held the sheet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we put the roll on this spindle,&rdquo; Cliff
said &ldquo;Then we run the end over this guide
roller, down through this &lsquo;gate&rsquo; and aperture
plate, so it lies flat, then over the lower guide,
and fix the end onto the spindle in the &lsquo;take-up&rsquo;
magazine at the bottom. Now she&rsquo;s all set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave the attached handle a small turn
and saw that the action was perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the lamp!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s O.K.,&rdquo; said Tom excitedly. &ldquo;I can
smell the gas and the base is tight now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the chief we make the other man&rsquo;s
magic work!&rdquo; he told Margery.</p>
<p>In her clear, treble tones she informed the
company. Outside the men pressed closer in.
There was a tense expectancy in the air. All
eyes focused on Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope the gasoline hasn&rsquo;t evaporated
out of this lighter,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good,
tight sort&mdash;well, here goes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snapped the wheel. The spark ignited
but did not light the wick.</p>
<p>Calmly, although his fingers trembled a little,
he closed the small case again and waited until
the wick had a chance to be covered for an instant
to accumulate some gas. Also he wanted
to control his own muscles.</p>
<p>Then again he whisked the small, steel wheel.</p>
<p>There was a spark and the wick sprang into
yellow light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>Carefully he lowered the flame, while he
opened the thumbscrew on the lantern burner.
There came a slight puff of light, like a little
explosion, a sizzling flare, and then the flame
settled down to an even, vividly brilliant white
glare.</p>
<p>Tom snapped shut the burner, shoved the
lamp into place in the casing so it was behind
the film.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crank her, Cliff,&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>And, to the marvelling gasp of the Indians
and the little shriek of amazement from Margery,
there appeared on the sheet of muslin a
square of gleaming white light, covering at
once by a moving picture showing a marching
army!</p>
<p>The Indians gasped, and several fell down on
their faces.</p>
<p>When that reel was over the chief, after a
long silence, spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Margery. &ldquo;He says the men
who have failed are to be sent to their fathers&mdash;that
means&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cowering, shrilly screeching with fear,
Henry and Mort tried to dash toward safety.
But at a sign from the chief the archers were
in the hut, and before the crawling pair of
white men appeared the other group, armed
with cudgels of knobbed, polished wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; shouted Tom. &ldquo;Tell him to stop,
Margery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearlessly he dashed in front of Henry and
Mort, and faced the men with the bows. In
one hand he held the closed lighter; in the other
he unrolled a piece of leader film torn from another
roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margery,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;tell that Indian that
our magic is good magic and is stronger. But
tell him that we want these men spared. Say
that if he does not we will use our magic to
pour fire on his village and we will burn it to
the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery, white-faced under her bronze, and
with tight lips, managed to gasp out enough to
make the chief listen.</p>
<p>Nevertheless he leaped out of his hammock
and strode forward.</p>
<p>Tom put up a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>He dropped the piece of curling film before
the chief&rsquo;s toes and stopping swiftly he ignited
the lighter and touched the edge of the film.</p>
<p>As he leaped back, covering his face from
the glare, the leader took fire and its celluloid
base, almost as combustible as dynamite, shot
into a blaze of white fire while a great, pungent
puff of smoke flung itself upward and began
to belly out in the still air of the hut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Instantly the chief dropped to the ground
like one stunned, and the archers, the councillors,
the medicine man and every other Indian
seemed to run away and vanish like the disappearance
of the film at the end of the magic
show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; gasped Tom, as Nicky and Cliff
dashed to his side, &ldquo;Margery&mdash;come here! I
guess we&rsquo;re safe for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again, as had been hinted when he first
saved Henry Morgan&rsquo;s life, Tom had performed
that service for the second time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">TWO MEN DISAPPEAR</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;These people will be your slaves from now
on,&rdquo; Margery said. &ldquo;I know them. They ran
to hide because they are afraid of you. If you
do what I tell you we can get away safely after
awhile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>He looked at Mort and Henry, crestfallen and
a little surly, standing by the motion picture
machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going off by ourselves,&rdquo; he told them.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you out of the trouble you made for
yourself, Henry&mdash;twice now,&rdquo; he was not boasting,
but stating it as a fact. &ldquo;I think the least
you can do is to be honest with us from here
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry nodded, curtly, nudged Mort, and
without a word of thanks, swung on his heel
and slunk out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to my hut,&rdquo; Margery suggested.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more comfortable to talk, and I&rsquo;ve fixed
up like a home in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>Unaware that the eyes of the man they had
saved were still burning hotly with resentment
at his own defeat, that he watched because he
was still determined to get what he wanted,
they walked across the dark square to a small
hut where an Indian girl, about a year older
than Margery, slept in a hammock. Margery
stuck the torch she had brought into a makeshift
holder against a supporting pillar of wood,
and showed the three chums her makeshift
home.</p>
<p>She had preserved some of her American
taste of love and comfort, in spite of the hardships.
There, with the other girl dismissed
firmly, she and Tom took their first brother-and-sisterly
embrace and the girl, now very shy,
clasped hands with the two who had come with
Tom to her rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;Sis&rsquo;, are you too tired to
tell us some about yourself? It can wait&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel better if we know
everything all together. I&rsquo;ve had a dreadful
time. But it will soon be over&mdash;thanks to you
three fine friends. I love you all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she told them her story. After her
parting with Tom, when he was prevented from
going with her and his father to Mexico, she
and their father had gone to the land of the chili
bean and the tamale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>On the way their father had fallen into conversation
with a man who was going back to
Mexico &ldquo;to work a mine.&rdquo; He had tried to sell
it but had failed; its samples of ore were not
very convincing, although its owner had great
faith that he was nearly ready to tap a fine
vein of ore. But his health was poor and the
Mexican climate, even among the hills, was
detrimental to recovery; he wanted to dispose
of his holdings.</p>
<p>Their father told her, Margery said, that he
was going to look at the mine before they went
on to the Dead Hope, and if he liked it he might
take an option on it.</p>
<p>He did so, but the man, when he found that
Mr. Carrol considered the property good,
begged him to buy it outright so he could take
the money and go to Nevada to grow better.
Mr. Carrol had agreed to take a half-interest
and the papers had been drawn up.</p>
<p>They had then gone on to the Dead Hope
mine. He had, in Mexico City, left the man who
sold him the half-interest in the mine.</p>
<p>With bated breath she disclosed his identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mort Beecher!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great grief!&rdquo; gasped Nicky. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;wait till
I see him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h!&rdquo; she warned. &ldquo;He went off with the
money father paid him and I guess he spent it
in wild parties. But let me tell you the rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first night we were at the Good Hope
mine house we were waked up by horses galloping,
guns firing, men yelling. Father looked
out and said it was bandits making an attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was gold dust there,&rdquo; Tom interrupted.
She nodded and went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father got his gun and told me to stay quiet
and not to leave the shack. He had to go to
help the mine people. The mine was part of
the property of the firm he was paid by, you
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he left you alone?&rdquo; Nicky was surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only while he helped drive off the bandits.
He thought they would be frightened away.
But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she wiped her eyes on her sleeve, for
there were no handkerchiefs in that primitive
place, &ldquo;Father&mdash;didn&rsquo;t&mdash;come&mdash;back&mdash;ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I wish we knew who fired
the shot that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we never will know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
this is what is important now. Father gave me
some folded papers out of his pocket and said
I must keep them until&mdash;he came back. But
the fighting got worse and I was frightened.
People began falling down in the open place
and I was awfully scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been terrible,&rdquo; Cliff said, sympathetically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a man coming across the open place
and it was Mort Beecher, only I didn&rsquo;t recognize
him at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tom said, &ldquo;he rescued you, Henry told
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Henry said you ran out while he held
the horse, and Mort saved you,&rdquo; Cliff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t so, at all,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I
did not run out! I was obeying father. But
when I saw that man coming I thought I&rsquo;d hide
the papers, because father had said they were
partnership agreements and a deed. So I&mdash;put
them&mdash;under a board&mdash;it was loose&mdash;right under
where the old stove stood.&rdquo; The youths
nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mort Beecher came in and said he
would save me, and he picked me up and carried
me out to a mule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought, all along, that Mort was the
real bandit,&rdquo; Nicky said. &ldquo;What you say all
checks up. He sold part of the mine and then,
when he found out there was gold dust to be
taken he wanted to get the agreements back and
have the money too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he was the real bandit leader, why
did he rescue me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he ask you about the papers?&rdquo; Tom
questioned.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;But not for a long time. After all the excitement
was over. Then I said I didn&rsquo;t have
any papers and he was disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he get you away&mdash;Henry said he
defended the pass while you were taken off,
and that it was only ten minutes&mdash;but the gold
was gone and so were you and Mort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the trail we stopped. Mort unloaded
the sacks and dropped them over the edge. I
thought it must be awfully deep, but when he
hit the burros and sent them flying up the trail
he got down over the edge of the cliff and told
me to jump into his arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you did?&rdquo; gasped Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was only down about six feet. Then
he made me bend low and I saw the edge hung
over a sort of shallow place under it. So we
hid there while the bandits went past. After a
long time he crawled up on the trail and pulled
me up, and made me give him a sack of the gold
dust first. Then we climbed an awful trail,
up the side of the hill, and hid in a cave. After
that night he went away and left me; I thought
he wouldn&rsquo;t come back, but he did&mdash;with food.
Then we went on to where he had a mule&mdash;he
must have caught it on the pass. We rode for
ever so long, and finally we came to where a hut
was. Old people lived there. He said we were
lost and begged for food and they gave us some.
After that we rode on again and he was always
afraid the bandits would find us, and our mule
got worn out and we had to leave him and walk.
Then we got to where some more people lived
and he bribed them with some gold dust and
they gave him a mule and then we rode from
there. Finally we came to a city; he disguised
the sack with some old oilskins he found, and
I think he sold the gold dust gradually to some
banks, for we stayed there&mdash;it was a long time,
I don&rsquo;t remember how long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;The bandits must have traced him,&rdquo; Nicky
suggested. &ldquo;For Henry said&mdash;no, it was Jack&mdash;we
found Jack in Porto Bello, but never mind&mdash;he
said Mort had told him, while they drank&mdash;they
did that a lot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worse mixed up than a shaker full
of soda water!&rdquo; laughed Tom. &ldquo;What he&rsquo;s
trying to say is that in tracing you we found a
man who told us part of Mort&rsquo;s story as Mort
told it to him. It was that bandits followed
Mort and he took you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a boat, and kept me in the cabin and
disguised me and said I was his daughter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you cried and the stewardess got suspicious&mdash;&rdquo;
Cliff added. They were all trying
to tell what they knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we were put ashore on a San Blas
Indian island,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;Tom, you remember
how I loved to doctor my dolls and all?
Well, I saw how the Indians lived and when I
could make them understand and learned a few
words I doctored them as well as I could&mdash;and
all of a sudden, one night, some Indians from
inland came&mdash;and they took me away. They
thought I was a great spirit or something. But
I didn&rsquo;t have any medicines and I wasn&rsquo;t very
old and so I couldn&rsquo;t help them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they send you back?&rdquo; demanded
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they were afraid of being caught for
what they had done,&rdquo; Nicky suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be it,&rdquo; Margery agreed. &ldquo;They
didn&rsquo;t make me prisoner or anything and they
always treat me nice; but they didn&rsquo;t have any
use for me if I couldn&rsquo;t cure them and so I
just stayed and stayed because I didn&rsquo;t know
how to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll get away now!&rdquo; declared Nicky
bravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the deeds and the partnership
papers?&rdquo; demanded Tom. &ldquo;What did you
do with them? They&rsquo;d be mighty valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hid them the minute father went out,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the mine shack&mdash;at the Dead Hope?&rdquo;
Nicky cried.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;Under a board in the floor, under the stove,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; cried Cliff, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why Henry was
so anxious to find Mort and to get you and learn
about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;and the rest of the gold dust,&rdquo; Tom
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they owe us their lives now,&rdquo; Nicky
asserted. &ldquo;We can share some of what&rsquo;s rightfully
ours, and especially the half-interest in the
Golden Sun mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, outside in the dark, there was a pair
of ears that heard and a brain that was bound
that no one should share except Mort and
Henry.</p>
<p>Once before Henry had repaid the saving of
his life by treachery.</p>
<p>He was planning to do so again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better let Margery
get some sleep. When the Indians come around
in the morning we can plan to leave as soon as
possible.&rdquo; That was agreed to.</p>
<p>They were awakened soon after dawn by a
tumult and excitement in the square. Margery
met them, her hair blowing in the morning
breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two white men have gone!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;They left during the night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess they have gotten enough of
this place,&rdquo; Tom conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the men are getting ready to pursue
them&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them!&rdquo; Tom cried. &ldquo;We saved
them last night. Tell the chief it is Big Boy
Tom&rsquo;s will that they be allowed to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery sped away on her light feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That returns good for evil,&rdquo; Tom said to
Cliff and Nicky. &ldquo;They only want to escape.
They don&rsquo;t know what we know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But&mdash;they did!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">AGAINST ODDS</span></h2>
<p>Out from the mainland came a canoe. In it
were two white people. They paddled stolidly
and steadily, although several other canoes
were close behind them, and at their sides, their
occupants screaming and demanding in their
high, shrill women&rsquo;s voice, the return of the
commandeered canoe.</p>
<p>Bill, Andy, Jack, Mr. Gray and Bob, on the
cruiser, at anchor not far from a dingy, white
sloop, watched curiously, and a little anxiously.
Who were the men? They were men, not boys!
But they were too far away to be recognized,
if they were known, even with glasses trained
on them. All that was to be seen was the anger
of the canoeists around them and the lifting
of an oar, with which they drove back too venturesome
canoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>The cruiser&rsquo;s party, having made every effort
to locate the missing Tom, Cliff and Nicky,
even at risk of getting lost in the jungles themselves,
had finally been forced to give up the
search. They were lying at anchor, simply waiting,
hoping against hope that something would
give them a clue to the youths.</p>
<p>Mort Beecher and Henry Morgan, in their
commandeered&mdash;to use a polite word&mdash;canoe,
gave the cruiser plenty of seaway, and passed
her well on the far side. However, Bill, using
the glasses, recognized Henry and set up a
shout. It was decided to row over to the sloop,
on which they were seen to embark; at once
Bob got the boat up and he, Andy and Bill
tumbled in; but before they were half-way over
the lagoon to the outer water which had depth
for the deep-keeled sloop, she had hoisted sail
and was bearing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; Bill commented, when, giving
up, they returned to the <i>Porto Bello</i>. &ldquo;They
didn&rsquo;t come near us, and how they did hurry
that boat away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could not have seen or heard of our
boys,&rdquo; Mr. Gray said. &ldquo;They would, in decency,
have stopped to tell us, no matter how
great their haste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were in a big hurry,&rdquo; Bill reflected.
&ldquo;I wonder why! They had no one with them.
Could they have found Tom&rsquo;s sister? In that
case they would have brought her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got into this Chucunaque country and
came out safe again,&rdquo; suggested Andy. &ldquo;Might
the lads have got there too?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>They could come to no conclusion, and while
they all agreed that there was something decidedly
strange about the haste with which Henry
Morgan and Mort Beecher sailed North, and
their avoidance of the very men who had helped
Henry, they dared not go in pursuit to compel
the elusive Henry to reveal his &rsquo;Cause why!</p>
<p>Nearly a week later, after being treated with
dignity accorded to people of real prestige, Tom
Nicky, Cliff and Margery were permitted, well-escorted,
to leave the Chucunaque&rsquo;s village for
the coast.</p>
<p>Probably the chief&rsquo;s experience with the motion
picture film helped to establish them as true
wonder-workers. The chief had seen Tom&rsquo;s
startling demonstration of fire, when he used
the strip of celluloid &ldquo;leader&rdquo; torn off the end
of a film. He therefore feared Tom until one
of his medicine men, a little jealous of the white
lad&rsquo;s superior prestige, whispered that there
was no great trick or secret, that he, too, could
produce the smoke and flame with a piece of the
picture-ribbon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>Nicky, Tom, Cliff and Margery, walking from
but to hut, visiting the hammock-bound sick
people, who believed that if Tom touched them
it. would help to heal them, saw the portable
picture projector apparatus, abandoned by
Henry, being examined by the chief. He gingerly
touched it, but his medicine man, with a
contemptuous grunt, drew a length of the coiling
film out of the lower magazine and ripped off
a short bit. This he handed to the chief with
some directions. The chief, hesitating, walked
gingerly to the fire over which the community
cook-pot hung, and stood irresolute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Tom,&rdquo; Nicky whispered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying
to nerve himself to make your magic. If he
does, we are beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; Cliff retorted. &ldquo;I examined
the film, this morning. I wondered why the
film was so combustible when it was to be used
on a ship and with an open light. I saw the
reason. The &lsquo;leader part&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t supposed to be
&lsquo;threaded-up&rsquo; in the beam of heat from the
light; it is to go down to the lower magazine
and so it can be of ordinary celluloid base film.
But the real picture is on what is called &lsquo;non-flam&rsquo;
which is a celluloid base especially treated
and with chemical constituents that make it
smoulder when it gets hot, but it won&rsquo;t burst
into flame or explode. The chief has a bit of
the picture itself, so Tom&rsquo;s laurels are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>It proved that he was right, for when the
film was cast into the fire it only curled up and
smouldered into ash, whereas Tom, to &ldquo;make
good&rdquo; his own standing, at Cliff&rsquo;s behest secretly
secured a bit of &ldquo;leader&rdquo; from a second
roll of the film and then &ldquo;put on a show&rdquo; for
the chief which impressed the monarch so much
that he ordered his bowmen at once&mdash;and the
jungle resounded to the crashing escape of a
medicine man who had advised jealously but
not too wisely.</p>
<p>In time the sick had been touched and Margery&rsquo;s
request that she be allowed to go with
the chums was granted; she promised to send
back, by the guards, all the medicines on the
cruiser, and when, after the days in the jungle
trails the quartet reached the head of a small
stream, and thence were hurried to the coast in
canoes, they set foot again on the smooth white
deck, she kept her word. All the medicine was
sent, with careful instructions for its use according
to the diseases prevalent in the country;
other gifts were heaped upon the messengers
and they left with the first smiles that
any white man had seen on their stolid faces
for many years. In return they loaded Margery
and the chums with their cloth into which
was woven many designs which later proved to
be a key to many links of the modern Indians
with ancient civilization.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>Margery was greeted with much delight by
Bill and Jack. Both of them were old enough,
as was Mr. Gray, to realize that what worried
Tom, her childishness, her habits of the girl
of eleven in a body of a miss of sixteen, would
soon be outgrown in new surroundings.</p>
<p>There was great excitement and a regular
banquet to celebrate the return, and over plates
of tinned meats and broiled yams, turtle and
freshly caught fish, the youths related their experiences
to an eager audience; but they hardly
finished when Bill slapped his knee, almost upsetting
all their crockery as he shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you let Henry Morgan and Beecher go?
And you thought they&rsquo;d quit? Where were you
lads when you and Margery talked over her
story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her hut!&rdquo; cried Tom, starting as he recalled
a former time when Toosa had declined
certain facts and an eavesdropper had overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean?&mdash;&rdquo; began Nicky. &ldquo;Why&mdash;let
me get hold of that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would explain why they avoided us
and why the sloop sailed North in such a
hurry,&rdquo; Jack declared. He was much more of
a self-respecting man than he had been even
when the youths saw him last. He had control
of himself, and took pride in his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy&mdash;Bob&mdash;&rdquo; called Bill, &ldquo;get up the anchors
and make everything shipshape. We&rsquo;ve
got enough provisions for a run back to
Mexico?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; responded Andy, fussing over
his spark plugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;If what Margery said
was overheard and our enemies have a start of
us, we&rsquo;ll have to try hard to catch them before
they get to Mexico&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, before they get under those floor
boards!&rdquo; Nicky added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make her hum, Andy,&rdquo; Cliff said, taking
up his duties as oiler and engineer&rsquo;s assistant.</p>
<p>And so again, Northbound, the <i>Porto Bello</i>
nosed into the Caribbean!</p>

<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">GOLDEN BAIT</span></h2>
<p>During the long race back to Mexico the
cruiser&rsquo;s party never caught up with the lost
time. Henry and Mort were always ahead;
at Colon a tramp steamer had them aboard;
at Vera Cruz they debarked; at Mexico City
they were still ahead.</p>
<p>So it was that when the party reached the
Dead Hope mine they were quite prepared for
what they found.</p>
<p>Henry Morgan and Mort Beecher had come
there four days before; yes, the superintendent
explained, they represented that they had
bought a mine location adjoining the Dead
Hope. Yes, they asked to let them sleep in the
old shack at the edge of his Dead Hope property
until they could level off a place on the
shaggy hillside for their own mine shaft and
shack. No, he told them, he did not know
whether they had done any exploring in the old
shack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>On a warm afternoon Tom, Nicky, Cliff, Bill
and Margery stood in the old, rickety shack, its
corrugated metal sides almost ready to drop
apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see for yourself,&rdquo; said the superintendent.
&ldquo;It looks as if they&rsquo;ve done some
explorin&rsquo;, at that.&rdquo; He had been told a good
many facts concerning the adventures the
chums had been through, the cause for their
trip, and some deductions concerning the solution
of the mystery of the missing gold dust
which Bill, Jack and the chums had figured out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly have been hunting for those
papers Margery hid,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;I guess we
are beaten. If they find the papers they will
destroy the partnership agreement father got,
and change the deeds in some way, and then,
of course, neither Margery nor I can do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve torn up the old floor boards
under the stove,&rdquo; said Cliff, and Nicky echoed
his statement. Jack, who came in, stared out
of the dusty, grimy window, with its bit of
rag stuffed into a broken pane, and did not seem
to care much what was going on. He appeared
to be trying to get his newly awakened memory
to reveal some further pictures of his past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if there was anything under the
floor&mdash;or a place for it,&rdquo; Bill suggested, but
Margery touched his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to remember something,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and I have. Tom, Nicky, Cliff&mdash;Bill&mdash;&rdquo;
she beckoned them close and whispered.
They stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stove isn&rsquo;t where it was when I hid
the&mdash;papers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; gasped Tom. &ldquo;Then&mdash;where was it before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to another corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paper may still be under there, then.
They haven&rsquo;t torn up those boards.&rdquo; Tom
started across the floor. He stopped. Nicky
was scratching his left ear. At the same instant
Margery touched Bill&rsquo;s arm and they all
became very quiet, except Margery who, in a
whisper, gasped into Tom&rsquo;s ear: &ldquo;Now do just
as Bill said to do if Mort or Henry appeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom nodded. In the dimly lit room, bare except
for a bed and a stove and a chair with
one leg gone, he and Cliff and Nicky and his
sister, with Bill and Jack, were as silent as
statues. So that Henry Morgan strolling with
his mind far away, got half-way through the
door before he discovered them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;say!&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Mort? And
how are you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;Um&mdash;er&mdash;oh! Fine. Fine! &rsquo;Cause why?
&rsquo;Cause we see you got this little lady safe away
from the Indians. We knew you would. I said
to Mort, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve told the Indians to take good
care of them till they want to leave and then
take them safe to the shore.&rsquo; He said &lsquo;Seems
like deserting them, seems like,&rsquo; but we had to
hurry, because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once his &rsquo;Cause why was forgotten in his
effort to hide his surprise. &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;We had to
keep an appointment with the captain of a
sloop&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Tom, playing a
part which Bill, Jack and the chums, and even
Mr. Gray, had decided was the surest way to
lull suspicion of what they really meant to accomplish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d see it. &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause
you&rsquo;re a fine feller. Tom, we fixed it all up
with the Indians about letting Miss Margery
go and then we come on back here. &rsquo;Cause why?
Mort had remembered about his Golden Sun.
It was a mine and he was anxious we should be
partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom felt that Henry had mixed himself up
in enough half-falsehoods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said, with his eyelids lifted and
brows arched, playing his part in laying a trap.
&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why, in the old days, Mort didn&rsquo;t tell
you where the gold dust went&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry darted closer and eagerly demanded:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know? Do you know anything? I
didn&rsquo;t learn nothing &rsquo;cause Mort got chased
by the bandits and hid and then went to Central
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to count too much
on him for a partner,&rdquo; Tom added to his story
as Bill had arranged that he should, if circumstances
allowed him to do so. &ldquo;Henry&mdash;what
would you say if I showed you how the gold
dust disappeared&mdash;and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d be grateful. Of course, it won&rsquo;t
do any good now, but it would be nice to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; Tom urged, and the whole
party, with Bill nudging Nicky to prevent the
youth from doubling up with glee, went up the
old trail to a spot well remembered as the point
where the youths first met Henry Morgan&mdash;the
man who then boasted that he could &ldquo;smell
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said, when we first saw you, that you
could smell money,&rdquo; said Tom. Henry nodded.
&ldquo;Your nose must have been out of joint,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Look here.&rdquo; He approached the ledge,
and pointed overside. Henry, cautiously, drew
close and looked; then he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&mdash;it&rsquo;s only down about six feet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a narrow ledge about six feet
down&mdash;of course the chasm is below, but you
could get down to the narrow ledge&mdash;and, here&rsquo;s
a little secret&mdash;the ledge goes back in under
the overhang of rock&mdash;if you get on your stomach
and look over, you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Henry, after he had looked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
like a narrow cave under this overhang I&rsquo;m lying
on.&rdquo; He stared back again. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that,
like something black, down on the ledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; said Tom, pretending to be uninterested.
&ldquo;That is the last sack of the gold
dust. Here&rsquo;s where the mules were stopped
and where Mort dropped the sacks of dust and
then, later, he and Margery were down there,
hiding, when the&mdash;bandits!&mdash;rode past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be swiggle-swiggered!&rdquo; gasped
Henry. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to be done with that
sack of dust? And where&rsquo;s the rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a man from the Dead Hope is coming
back for it&mdash;he just took another one out. This
is the last. We&rsquo;re going to lock it up with the
rest of the mine&rsquo;s nuggets and dust, in that old
shack, tonight. In the morning we&rsquo;ll all escort
it to the city. We can&rsquo;t do anything more here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you come here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just to look up some papers Margery
says father gave her and she hid in the old
shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all saw the cunning light in Henry&rsquo;s
eyes. &ldquo;But you ain&rsquo;t found no papers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>Tom laughed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The stove
has been moved since Margery hid our papers
under the boards beneath it&mdash;she thinks it used
to be in the far corner&mdash;by the window. We
haven&rsquo;t looked there, though. I don&rsquo;t think she
remembers after all these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry made an excuse and hurried away.
Tom looked at his sister and his chums and
then, of a sudden, they all smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve baited a trap&mdash;hope
we get two rats!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">THE RATS COME</span></h2>
<p>Tom took a firm grip of Cliff, on one side,
and of Nick, on the other; to the latter he whispered:
&ldquo;Here they come! If you make a false
move I&rsquo;ll make mince-meat of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Nicky.</p>
<p>Black night had descended over the Dead
Hope mine and its new neighbor, the Golden
Sun. The two new partners of that latest venture
had hastily taken their few belongings
from the Dead Hope shack when Henry learned
from Tom that it would be needed for gold-dust
storage that night.</p>
<p>To all appearances the shack, standing dark
and still, and the hillside behind it, were
wrapped in slumber.</p>
<p>Two dull figures, as quiet as ghosts, slipped
along in the gloomiest parts of the shadow,
close to brush, hugging the cliff, or slinking
under the shack windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like nobody&rsquo;s around, seems like,&rdquo;
Mort whispered. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that sort of funny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was a guard,&rdquo; Henry said in his
hoarse, but subdued rumble. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t around&mdash;&rsquo;Cause
why? &rsquo;Cause Henry attends to everything.
He was leaning out the window when I
sneaked around the side of the shack first time,
spying. Well&mdash;there&rsquo;s his hat.&rdquo; He kicked the
sombrero lying on the ground under the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackjack, heh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw. Cudgel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the main thing is not to wake up the
camp,&rdquo; Henry said. &ldquo;Last time we played
bandits we come with guns and a gang at our
backs. But this time it&rsquo;s different. &rsquo;Cause
we are workin&rsquo; alone and I mean to see that
you don&rsquo;t get the best of me this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like you never will get over that
idear, seems like,&rdquo; Mort grunted. &ldquo;I tell you
and tell you&mdash;I had the little gal to watch out
for and I tried to find you but the others was
too close behind me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all come back to us, anyhow, except
what you wasted in Colon&mdash;one sack was
all you took, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one, Hen. Yes, it&rsquo;s come back. Now
we&rsquo;d better get it and get the papers out from
where the stove used to be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we was pulling up boards in the wrong
place. That&rsquo;s kids for you&mdash;she remembers
where she hid stuff and her brother tells us as
nice as pie and never plans to bother to look.
Thinks his sister has forgot&mdash;like that silly old
codger, Jack, we saw down to Porto Bello!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep! Well, Hen, let&rsquo;s get in through the
window&mdash;or will you let me hand you the sacks
and you take &rsquo;em to where we got the burros
tied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work right together,&rdquo; Henry declared.
&ldquo;Here, you get in there and I&rsquo;ll be right behind
you. Watch. Go easy. Don&rsquo;t come down hard
onto the guard&mdash;I hit him and he dropped inward&mdash;don&rsquo;t
step on &rsquo;im if you can help it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;but they ain&rsquo;t any guard here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he crawled off from under the window.
Get in&mdash;let me get there after you. Hurry,
you slow poke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mort hastened all his fat bulk would permit.
Then Henry got in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was sure the
guard fell in the room when I poked the cudgel
down onto his fat head! But, he must of come
to life and crawled off. Don&rsquo;t hear nothing so
he hasn&rsquo;t sounded any alarm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got the flashlight? Turn it this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry unslung a small pocket lamp and
switched on its beam. Throwing it over the
room he gave an exclamation of delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s them sacks o&rsquo; dust&mdash;and some of
nuggets, by the feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lost no time in dragging some of the
buckskin pouches from the top of the pile and
dropping them out of the window so they could
get to the bulkier flour sacks and gunny sacks
beneath them. When they had lifted until they
were tired, they decided to transfer what they
had dropped under the window to the backs of
the mules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; admonished Mort. &ldquo;Seems like
we better get at the papers, seems like. Then,
if we&rsquo;re chased, we know we haven&rsquo;t left that
partnership agreement and deed for the kids
to find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise idea,&rdquo; agreed Henry. &ldquo;Take this flash,
and put it so&rsquo;s it can&rsquo;t be noticed outside. Then
I&rsquo;ll pry up the boards&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;a girl of nine
or ten or so would never have tools&mdash;and she
was excited when you come in, wasn&rsquo;t she,
Mort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like she was, way I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the stove was about here&mdash;yep, here&rsquo;s
the spots where the heat warped the wooden
floor. Now&mdash;Mort, where was the little gal
standing that night when you come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well as I recall&mdash;I come in the door, and
she was&mdash;just about like you are now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that settles it. She had just straightened
up, I bet. &rsquo;Cause why? Look at that board
along the wall. Loose, I&rsquo;ll bet. See! A kid
could get her fingers almost under the edge&mdash;enough
to lift it&mdash;and sure enough! Here they
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrenched savagely at the long, narrow
board, and lifted it enough to get his arm
through and fish out some mouldy looking
paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; warned Mort. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly falling
to bits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the outer wrappers,&rdquo; Henry whispered,
holding the papers close to the electric
beam, already growing dim. &ldquo;See&mdash;the inside
papers are all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry up and make sure what they
are. We want the deed and we might as well
take the others and tear &rsquo;em up where the
pieces won&rsquo;t get us in trouble. Hurry, though.
The battery is going down on that flashlamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the deed all right,&rdquo; Mort took one paper
and unfolded it partly. &ldquo;I recall how this
corner was tore off where it was signed, and I
made a patch onto it&mdash;only with my name instead
of&mdash;that other &rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is the partnership paper. I won&rsquo;t
tear it up yet&mdash;but what are these other
things?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe more of his deeds,&rdquo; Mort said. &ldquo;You
know, the night you was chief of the bandits
and I helped, you said we ought to find more
deeds for mines because he was representin&rsquo; a
company&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you hadn&rsquo;t shot him!&mdash;&rdquo; accused
Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shot him? You got rats! You done that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look at the papers and let&rsquo;s go back
to toting gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry, with the flash bulb now merely a dim,
yellowish filament, held a paper close to his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he almost forgot his caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&mdash;Henry Morgan&mdash;do confess,&rsquo;&rdquo; he began,
then flung aside the paper and opened the last
one feverishly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mort strained his eyes at the first,
but Henry, snatching the lamp and using it,
snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got all about you being a bandit and
shooting the gringoes&mdash;&ldquo;(Americans)&mdash;&ldquo;and
lots more, Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this confession is about you and how
you stole from me and your pals and hid the
gold dust and took the little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;what of it? Who put them there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did!&rdquo; snapped a sharp voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you might as well sign the confessions!&rdquo;
said another.</p>
<p>Whirling, dazzled by two vivid white beams
cast on them from large flashlamps protruding
through the window, the two, caught red-handed,
blinked and stammered in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the Mexican police,&rdquo; declared one of
three men who promptly handcuffed the two
dazed culprits.</p>
<p>Tom, Nicky, Cliff, Bill, Jack, Mr. Gray, the
mine superintendent&mdash;and Margery&mdash;everybody
was trooping into the doorway and the
small room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heard every word they said, we crept
right under the window,&rdquo; Nicky said. He turned
to Tom, &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t make a false move, did
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a one,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;The only false move
was the one these men made trying to get the
best of three boys, as they thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they can sign those confessions and
save you a lot of trouble,&rdquo; said one of the Mexican
officials. Mort looked at Henry and his
look was returned&mdash;there was nothing else to
do so the confessions checking and verifying
the duplicity of the two&mdash;and worse!&mdash;were
duly signed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what became of the guard I hit?&rdquo; asked
Henry, when he had been told how they were
surrounded all the time they talked and worked,
and Tom answered: &ldquo;Oh, Nicky and I were inside
here with a hat and wadded sacks around
a broomstick, to seem like a man in sombrero
and poncho, leaning out of the window. When
you &lsquo;socked&rsquo; at them we let the hat drop off
and put the rest over in the corner&mdash;there they
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly outwitted us,&rdquo; said Mort,
grudging admiration, but compelled to admit
defeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; it was Jack, the man who had
no memory until he left Porto Bello&mdash;&ldquo;Just
wait a bit. Mort Beecher&mdash;you that was with
me so long in Porto Bello, and I never guessed&mdash;listen
to this! Who crept in my room in a
Colorado camp bunk house and stole my deeds,
that I was carrying from one ranch to another&mdash;and
who, by doing that, ruined my reputation,
caused me to leave the State, and made
the wreck who ended up on the beach at Porto
Bello?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; demanded the handcuffed
Mort, but he shivered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>&ldquo;You should know by this!&rdquo; snapped Jack.
&ldquo;Oh, I got my memory back at last, and I can
remember as well as anything how a piece was
torn off the bottom of one deed, the one you tore
taking it out of my bunk! It was my own deed,
to my own mine, I had just bought, down in
Mexico. You thought the corner of the paper
was lost. It wasn&rsquo;t! It was left in my bunk
and I had it in my old wallet down in Porto
Bello all the time; only, I had been there so
long I didn&rsquo;t recall anything. But I brought
away the wallet and here is that piece of paper
with my signature on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly Tom grasped the deed to the Golden
Sun, transferred, supposedly, to one Morton
Beecher. From Jack&rsquo;s worn, faded wallet he
fitted to its patched corner a bit of paper, yellow
and mildewed, but an exact fit!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Margery and I will have you for a half-partner
instead of that&mdash;&rdquo; Tom made a face
toward Mort who was being led, with head bent,
toward his imprisonment and trial, with Henry,
for their many sins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Tell you what I&rsquo;ll do.
You always liked mining and you say you used
to prospect in Peru for mines. How about trading
my share in this Golden Sun for your ranch
in Colorado?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our old Bill will be our partner,&rdquo;
chuckled Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll take Cliff and Nicky into partnership,
too, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Margery pleaded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>&ldquo;As to that!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, with a grand
air, and waving a hand like an orator, while
he stuck the other arm into the bosom of his
coat, &ldquo;I believe we shall have to take that up
with the board of directors&mdash;in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">SUNSET</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The reason I didn&rsquo;t want to talk about
shares, last night,&rdquo; Tom told his sister, late the
next afternoon, &ldquo;was because we don&rsquo;t actually
own a dollar&rsquo;s worth of that mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were sitting outside the mine shack.
Henry and Mort had been lodged in a Mexican
prison. They were merely waiting until Mr.
Gray would be ready to leave the mines. Bill
and Jack had attended to the necessary legal
formalities. But Mr. Gray learned that the
mine superintendent had discovered a regular
hoard of old Aztec relics in the fastness of the
hills and Mr. Gray proposed to go with
him to inspect them the next day. He might
decide to remain the rest of the late summer
and collect and arrange the relics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t she own a dollar of the mine?&rdquo;
Nicky demanded. &ldquo;She hid the paper. Her
father paid for half the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he paid Mort, and Mort can&rsquo;t return
the money, and he had no right to sell the mine.
It was really Jack&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jack, ambling up, &ldquo;did I hear
my name mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly did,&rdquo; declared Cliff. &ldquo;Tom
says he can&rsquo;t touch the mine at all because it&rsquo;s
all yours and what his father paid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please&mdash;please!&rdquo; gasped Mort&rsquo;s former
beach combing partner of Porto Bello. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
make me weep. Don&rsquo;t make me laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t be
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s look at it this way.
Your father paid in good earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom nodded, and Margery, beside him,
smiled and gave vigorous assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And because Mort was greedy and all, his
greed and lust has turned against him and has
brought me back to being a man through you
folks. But that don&rsquo;t pay for the mine, of
course. And it&rsquo;s a shame, too.&rdquo; He looked over
toward the mountains. The sun, declining, was
taking on the rich, golden hue, and the sky was
dyed, above a blood-red line just over the hills,
with a vast, swimming, pulsating light, a vivid
golden sea of beauty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; Jack added. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think
so, Bill?&rdquo; as Bill came up. &ldquo;What with us finding
that the Dead Hope vein has been struck
again, and they&rsquo;ve got their gold dust back and
our own mine has a vein of ore as thick as your
arm, about two feet under the rock&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it
too bad we can&rsquo;t sell shares to our friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell, yes! But not give!&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;how about making me
an offer. If you was to want the half-interest,
say, I might consider taking that&mdash;let me see&mdash;yes!
That cigar lighter that saved you in the
Chucunaque country. You don&rsquo;t smoke. It&rsquo;s
no good to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a keepsake,&rdquo; Tom said&mdash;and then
started&mdash;&ldquo;Golly! It isn&rsquo;t even mine to keep.
I took it from Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now and here make you a present of it!&rdquo;
said Bill magnanimously, &ldquo;and you keep it, too.
Jack may own that mine, but he&rsquo;s traded half
to me for my ranch, and he don&rsquo;t know which
half he&rsquo;s traded, so I guess nobody owns the
other half&mdash;so, why not claim it from him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that be right?&rdquo; asked Margery, her
eyes big and interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little sister,&rdquo; said Bill kindly, &ldquo;for lads like
Tom, and Cliff, and Nicky&mdash;and a girl like you!&mdash;anything
a decent fellow can do is&mdash;right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said Cliff.</p>
<p>Margery wasn&rsquo;t ashamed to hug Bill.</p>
<p>As for Tom, with just a little lump in his
throat for the fine chum Bill always was&mdash;Tom
couldn&rsquo;t think what to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>So, as Bill dragged out a cigarette, Tom said
nothing.</p>
<p>And lit the cigarette with his life-saving
lighter.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
